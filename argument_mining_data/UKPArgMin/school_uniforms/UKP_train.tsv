2781	Argument_for	Banning abortion risks illegal abortions .
2782	NoArgument	This in itself is a somewhat blurred line because each pregnancy is unique and the point at which different fetuses becomes viable is variable .

2790	NoArgument	I have evolved on abortion issue , like Reagan evolved Q : In 1999 , you said you were " very pro- choice . "
2791	Argument_against	They argue that a human fetus is a human being with a right to live , so abortion is similar to murder .
2792	Argument_against	That 's why even if pro-life advocates were hypocritical in this regard ( though I personally do n't know any abortion opponents who champion other sorts of murder ) that would say nothing about the main questions at hand : 1 ) when does human personhood begin and 2 ) should the law protect persons at all ages , locations , and stages of development .

2806	Argument_against	We envision a better day , a day when womanhood is celebrated , mothers are supported , fatherhood is honored and every child is cherished .
2807	Argument_for	And that pseudo-scientific argument — that an embryo is a person because it contains the DNA of a potential person — is true of any human cell , and certainly true of the countless fertilized eggs that , in the natural course of reproduction , are destroyed before they can develop .
2808	Argument_for	Cases where complications in the pregnancy lead to significantly higher risk to the woman ’s life are more frequent than we wish they would be .

2813	Argument_for	Spontaneous abortion stacks the odds in favor of healthy babies being born to healthy moms who will be able to nurse them .
2814	NoArgument	Fundamentally , the argument is sound ; society should not discriminate a person on an element for which he had no control over , and one can not choose to be a man or woman , their race , or their social status .

2816	NoArgument	In 1976 , after it was legalized in the United States , the number went down to 2 .

2823	NoArgument	Comments you post here may also appear on your Facebook page .
2824	NoArgument	The unborn child was going to die if nothing was done .
2825	NoArgument	Even supporting partial-birth abortion .
2826	Argument_against	Each person has the fundamental right to life and all that it entails .

2833	Argument_for	Cloning can help save lives .
2834	NoArgument	A : Professional ethics is a term that encompasses the organizational and personal standards of behavior a professional individual is expected to possess .

2836	NoArgument	Stem cells are special cells found in very early stage embryos ( 5 days after fertilization of an egg ) and in some types of adult tissue .
2837	Argument_for	But I think of it as a way of creating more livestock to end world hunger .

2839	NoArgument	Can it Go Too Far ?
2840	Argument_for	Some cloning advocates argue that cloning-to-produce-children might follow the same path as IVF , skipping from ethically unacceptable experimentation to a widely accepted practice .
2841	NoArgument	For that matter , how can you believe in a BOOK .
2842	Argument_for	But if someone is dying and needs an organ , and they choose to clone an organ of theirs or they already have a clone of themselves completely healthy , then HELL , it 's saving them !
2843	Argument_for	Of course the cons to therapeutic cloning is how much it costs , but this debate is more about ethics than anything else , and killing a human embryo to save a life IS ethical .
2844	NoArgument	Especially the posts that have nothing to do with cloning , and everything to do with their views on religion , which is fine , but just very off topic .
2845	NoArgument	The way i see it is that there can only be one right answer , if there is one at all .
2846	Argument_against	A cloned human being 's family , for example , is unlikely ever to see him as the original .
2847	Argument_against	Jesse Rainbow explain why there is an aversion to human cloning - a clone would not be a " real person " - cloning is " playing the God " - cloning is not " natural " mention in closing some of the conditions proposed in a provisional list yet , so research on therapeutic human cloning ( reproductive one is illegal ) to proceed lawfully : it is necessary for embryos to be used only in the early stages of their development , without being allowed to grow further , all programs research must be supervised by government organizations dealing with fertilization and genetic techniques , various research programs will receive funding and approval only if it is scientifically demonstrated that there is no other way of obtaining the same results conventional , will not be permitted to research on human genetic material can be combined with that of animals , there must be a permanent state of public information on research undertaken and to be postulated that the limitations may be required to report the experiences and suffering of animals used for human benefit .
2848	Argument_against	( e ) Cloning would undermine individuality and identity .
2849	NoArgument	There seems little doubt that the rapid advances that are occurring in the field of science , and biotechnology in particular , will continue to create new social and regulatory challenges , many of which may also raise issues associated with notions of human dignity .
2850	Argument_against	For those who do not believe that life is sacred , it is just tissue being disposed of .
2851	NoArgument	Media images of reproductive cloning , which are everywhere , often portray clones as " carbon copies " .
2852	NoArgument	The effect of most genes on health and well-being is not deterministic but probabilistic , and is subject to environmental influences .
2853	Argument_against	And it is vastly more practical to have a child within the context of marriage and a family than in a laboratory .
2854	NoArgument	It really is not difficult to understand how a clone fits into a family .
2855	NoArgument	The only difference is in the way the cloned individual is treated .
2856	NoArgument	Offers a new range of solutions .
2857	NoArgument	For example , Malby poses the question thus : " Does dignity impose a responsibility to protect a key feature of humanity ( our ' genetic heritage ' ) , from which ( to an undetermined extent ) we acquire key capacities such as autonomy and the capacity for moral thought ? "
2858	NoArgument	However , many groups have used a broader definition of cloning .
2859	Argument_against	Surely the scientist could be said to be responsible for the diseases and birth defects that would predictably result from having exposed the germ cells to radiation or other mutagens .
2860	Argument_for	We also could save endangered species , even revive extinct ones .
2861	Argument_for	Intentionally taking steps to create a child via cloning ( or any other kind of reproductive technology ) could be seen , instead , as a mutual affirmation of love on behalf of the prospective parents and clear evidence that they really desired the resulting child .
2862	NoArgument	Is it ‘ Right ’ ?
2863	Argument_against	And not haveus call on our selves to create more humans expecially for evil purposes like war .
2864	Argument_against	I believe that reproductive cloning will have little practical use , the health and safety concerns will likely endure for decades , and it may create some challenging genetic enhancement issues .
2865	NoArgument	An outright ban , he says , does not meet that standard .
2866	NoArgument	As noted by Shaun Pattinson in his critique of the Canadian government 's use of human dignity as a justification for a ban : " Once again we are left with the feeling that other arguments are in play but remain unsure as to what those arguments are " .
2867	NoArgument	In June , IPSOS/Reid found 42 % supported a complete ban , 39 % supported cloning only on human embryos , and 17 % preferred no restrictions on cloning .
2868	Argument_for	To help make a massive amount of crops and animals to help feed hunger .
2869	NoArgument	Kass instead uses the term “ repugnance . ”
2870	NoArgument	Using existing ES cell lines , including those created through cloning , scientists could continue to compare the efficacy of the two types of cell lines , while studies of the basic mechanisms of reprogramming can still be conducted using animal models .
2871	Argument_against	Reproductive cloning would entail dehumanizing experimentation " Just Say No To Human Cloning " .
2872	NoArgument	What we read is what the writer wanted us to remember .
2873	Argument_for	Permitting cloning , therefore , would allow for a more expedient means of creating a savior sibling , since the alternatives ( using preimplantation genetic diagnosis to screen embryos to determine which are genetically compatible with the sibling , implanting into a womb only the ones that are a match and discarding the others , or creating an embryo through natural reproduction and terminating the pregnancy if it is not a genetic match ) are more involved and more time consuming .
2874	Argument_for	Cloning , they claim , is a better technology for harvesting stem cells because it could mitigate problems of tissue rejection , since stem cells are cloned from the patient 's own body .
2875	NoArgument	I 'm not religious , by any standards , but to completely miss the point of the discussion is just irresponsible .
2876	NoArgument	These steps helped to create the atom bomb , even though the research was meant to further our knowledge of the universe .
2877	Argument_for	Many people believe that cloning will lead to loss of individuality eventually , but people have their own personality cloned which personality is similar to those in which they were created .
2878	NoArgument	Pence ’s specific examples here include the idea of a cloned child saying to his ancestor , “ If only you tried harder , Dad , you could ’ve published your book on James Joyce .
2879	NoArgument	To use a specific definition , the American Medical Association define cloning as the production of genetically identical organisms .
2880	NoArgument	But unlike in sexual reproduction , the egg donor and the somatic cell donor will make vastly unequal genetic contributions to the child .
2881	NoArgument	Cons : In order to restore the system or data to a previous state or to access files and documents , the backup software is required .
2882	NoArgument	Whether it is ethical to create children using experimental methods turns not only on the scientific evidence ( because , among other reasons , the scientific evidence will necessarily be decisively incomplete at first ) but also on the moral meaning of the relationship between prospective parents and their children .
2883	NoArgument	Unfortunately , it can be very difficult to pin down precisely what any of these claims really mean in the context of bioethical debate .
2884	NoArgument	Some technologies that allow individuals to plan their families , such as contraception , are approved by the vast majority of Americans , while others , such as abortion , are deeply divisive .
2885	NoArgument	This fact is partly attributable to confusion and partly to the different moral arguments that apply to the different ends cloning may serve .
2886	Argument_against	As Donald Bruce argues : " Willfully to copy the human genetic identity seems to go beyond something inherent in human dignity and individuality " .
2887	NoArgument	Again , the fact that there are identical twins counts against there being a problem .
2888	Argument_against	There is no justification for cloning , it is so inhumane in the sense that there are people on this earth with very cruel intentions and human cloning would allow for military use .
2889	Argument_for	Therapeutic cloning is most rewarding with stem cells which are not widely available .
2890	NoArgument	In this image of the family , the relationships and moral obligations of parents and children are not freely chosen , but are embedded in their biological and social contexts .
2891	Argument_for	If you knew one of your kids in the future was going to get Leukemia and knew that it could be cured , can you still say you would be against cloning knowing it could possibly save your child ?
2892	Argument_for	They could have every opportunity for intelligence as the person they were cloned from .
2893	Argument_for	Same as with animal clones , many have reproduced successfully and had healthy babies that survived through their adulthood .
2894	Argument_against	There is a reduced sense of individuality .
2895	Argument_against	Even if there is a utility for infertile parents , the ends ( obtaining a child ) do n't justify the means ( human cloning ) .
2896	Argument_for	Stem Cells are crucial to develop organisms .
2897	Argument_against	And medical problems continue to manifest during later stages of fetal development in cloned animals .
2898	NoArgument	Also the primary source of stem cells is from blastocysts .
2899	Argument_against	Even if the scientist had been able to find gamete donors to give free and informed consent to exposing their genetic offspring to such risks , the proper response would not be to conclude that , having obtained the consent of the relevant parties , the scientist conducted the study ethically .
2900	Argument_against	I agree that cloning is not a good thing .
2901	Argument_for	Absent other external factors ( such as social or parental expectations ) , an individual 's autonomy is not compromised solely because he/she does not have a unique genome .
2902	NoArgument	The choice was subjective : Nobody knows all the risks or all the possible outcomes , so we had to value it with our perception of the outcome .
2903	Argument_against	What if we manage to wipe out one disease only to introduce something brand new and even more dangerous ?
2904	Argument_against	Human cloning still has a lot of what ifs associated with it .
2905	Argument_for	Innovation That Can Change the World Cloning is innovation that is extremely powerful and has the ability to bring about huge change .
2906	NoArgument	Edited by : Burley J , Harris J. 2002 , Maiden , Mass : Blackwell Publisher , 245-252 .
2907	NoArgument	What code is in the image ?
2908	NoArgument	As a hypothetical situation , imagine a couple who had two embryos preserved after an IVF procedure .
2909	NoArgument	However , dissenters lost the political debate almost before it began .
2910	Argument_against	Human cloning violates the dignity and respect due to every human individual as it undermines the rights , identity and welfare of any child created in this way .
2911	NoArgument	Stem cell research promises to allow these undifferentiated stem cells to be stimulated to develop into various types of specialized cells or tissue .
2912	Argument_for	The most straightforward scenarios in which cloning could be used to prevent genetic disease involve what are called simple genetic diseases , or diseases that are caused by mutations in single genes and are passed on in accordance with the basic Mendelian rules of inheritance .
2913	NoArgument	Then while you are at it think about how acurate our history books are .
2914	Argument_against	If genes are modified to create smarter being those that are average will not have a place in society .
2915	Argument_against	However , if a virus is used as a reprogramming factor , it may activate oncogenes , which are cancer-causing genes .
2916	NoArgument	This file can also be protected or “ encrypted ” with a password .
2917	NoArgument	Which Groups of Americans Are Most Supportive of Cloning ?
2918	Argument_for	And it would allow gay men to have children without the use of donor eggs and a suragette .
2919	NoArgument	B ) Will cloning disrupt the natural order of things ?
2920	Argument_for	This is the best invention and we need to go with it .
2921	NoArgument	More importantly , reproductive cloning creates copied cells or tissues of an individual .
2922	Argument_against	From a more liberal standpoint , Mr Fukuyama worries about equality if inequality is designed into people 's genes .
2923	NoArgument	Follow Stephanie on Google + .
2924	NoArgument	Saying god did not put us on this earth and that humans were made just by sheer coincidence .
2925	Argument_against	Another scientific argument is that genetic diversity helps provide the " pool " of variations available for a robust human population .
2926	Argument_for	It could also help humans adapt to the growing problems of , for instance , global warming in the world .
2927	Argument_for	( While in most cases , the idea of cloning a dictator like Hitler is invoked as a criticism of eugenic schemes , some writers have actually advocated the selective eugenic propagation of tyrants — for instance , the American geneticist Hermann J. Muller who , in a 1936 letter to Stalin advocating the eugenic use of artificial insemination , named Lenin as an example of a source of genetic material whose outstanding worth “ virtually all would gladly recognize . ”
2928	NoArgument	It should not be treated as humanity 's savior .
2929	NoArgument	If he did n't want cloning to be possible it would n't be possible at all !
2930	NoArgument	Indeed , it could be argued that we should be focussing our policy making energy not on the technology but on the possible causes of the deterministic sentiments that may motivate the desire to use reproductive cloning .
2931	NoArgument	The representative of Costa Rica said the adoption of the Declaration today constituted a historic step to promote human rights and guarantee human dignity in all circumstances .
2932	NoArgument	Scientists are now able to take regular adult cells and tinker with their genes , turning back time to make these single-use cells pluripotent , or capable of differentiating into multiple cell types .
2933	Argument_against	There are powerful leaders in every generation who will seek to abuse this technology for their own purposes .
2934	NoArgument	just think a world without religion ( did you think of koas ) because that 's how it would be .
2935	NoArgument	Clearly , there is something to be discussed about this topic , but it is almost impossible to try to determine if human cloning is good or bad .
2936	Argument_against	Presently , it is far more expensive to clone than to reproduce animals by other means .
2937	Argument_for	Roughly one in five feel cloning would be justified either to save the life of the person being cloned , or to help infertile couples to have children without having to adopt .
2938	NoArgument	Mature or adult cells do not have the same attributes as the stem cells .
2939	Argument_for	Individualism will be maintained despite cloning , as " clones " will develop their own unique identities : Children produced by reproductive cloning will be ‘ clones ’ but not ‘ copies ’ of their parents : Different environmental factors , nurture , and the process of gestation mean that children will not be emotionally or mentally identical to the people from whom they are cloned .
2940	Argument_for	If cloning an existing person is acceptable here , this counterexample shows there is no valid dignity argument against cloning .
2941	Argument_for	Although SCNT is used to create embryos for therapeutic cloning , there is no intent to implant them in order to create children .
2942	NoArgument	By doing so , all data is saved into one single file .
2943	NoArgument	He had voted in favour of the Declaration .
2944	NoArgument	The fight for crucial federal dollars to fund stem cell research is not over .
2945	Argument_for	The practice is legal in other countries .
2946	NoArgument	As with any medical or genetic experimentation , there are certain merits and potential demerits of a particular concept .
2947	NoArgument	Excuse me , but who is going to raise such an army ( " raise " in the sense used by parents ) ?
2948	Argument_against	Having a clone may be beneficial at one point , but if there is more of you , potential loss of individuality is highly likely .
2949	NoArgument	What religion has brought was what they believe is the answer to life after death .
2950	Argument_against	Trying to treat a mitochondrial disease by turning back the clock on an adult cell 's genome would do nothing , because the messed-up mitochondrial DNA remains in the iPS cell .
2951	NoArgument	March 14 , 1997 - " One recurring image in anti-cloning propaganda is of some evil dictator raising an army of cloned warriors .
2952	NoArgument	European Union - European Convention on Human Rights prohibits human cloning in an additional protocol , but the protocol has been ratified only by Greece , Spain and Portugal .
2953	Argument_against	Some critics worry about a larger social effect , or even an effect on our species , if cloning restricted the diversity of children being born ( perhaps because parents and doctors might look for donors with a narrow range of characteristics , such as possessing high intelligence and meeting certain standards of physical beauty ) .
2954	NoArgument	The United States Constitution gives us express rights to believe whatever we want when it comes to religion and therefore I could say that my half-chicken , half-monkey god disapproves of cloning and it would be just as valid of an argument .
2955	NoArgument	We are commanded not to murder humans ( Ex .
2956	NoArgument	So imagine if a younger copy of the mother or father is created through cloning ?
2957	Argument_for	" As the technology advances , I think the legal and ethical and political dialogue should also go along with it , so we can face these potential future issues in a proactive kind of way , " he said .
2958	NoArgument	Whether it is true that cloning would transform procreation into a process of manufacturing can not be determined by examining the biological characteristics of children created through cloning .
2959	Argument_against	It was an inconceivable paradox that proponents of therapeutic cloning would sacrifice the life of one in order to serve another .
2960	NoArgument	There are only slight differences in support according to political party , but liberals ( 64 % ) and moderates ( 62 % ) are much more supportive than are conservatives ( 44 % ) .
2961	NoArgument	The catholics and other religions have that correct we did come from dust or should I say elements tea ting in such a way that it was perfect and life could thrive , but as people we see that as to big of a step and that it is imposibble .
2962	NoArgument	India ’s approach to therapeutic cloning , thus , remained unchanged .
2963	Argument_against	The available scientific evidence indicates that many or most children created through cloning would suffer from medical problems as a result of the procedure used to create them .
2964	NoArgument	Others will recoil apprehensibly at any such idea .
2965	Argument_against	they are murdering the next generation !!!!
2966	NoArgument	This argument is problematic for a number of reasons .
2967	NoArgument	Here , we will restate , expand upon , and update that report ’s arguments , defending them against the criticism they have received since 2002 and showing how the debate over cloning-to-produce-children is part of a broader conflict in our society between different understandings of the moral meaning of the family .
2968	Argument_against	That means that consumers who oppose animal cloning on animal welfare , religious , or moral grounds would be forced to unwittingly make purchases that violate their ethical principles .
2969	NoArgument	The fact that there had been no consensus on the issue after four years of discussion showed just how precarious the text was as adopted .
2970	Argument_against	This would then create premature aging issues and potentially even premature death , all because of the cloning process .
2971	NoArgument	A Pew Research Center poll , conducted in March 2001 , asked Americans what primarily influenced their thinking about unrestricted scientific research related to human cloning .
2972	Argument_for	Childless couples would be able to use cloning technology , and for many of them this may be preferable to IVF or surrogacy arrangements .
2973	Argument_against	There are other serious moral problems associated with cloning-for-biomedical-research , including the exploitation of women who will be needed to provide eggs .
2974	NoArgument	science is like a bullet and any intelligent person would not stand in the way , but for the life of me I ca n't understand this .
2975	Argument_against	Every time a clone is made it is like throwing the dice and even a string of " healthy " clones being born would not change the likelihood that many clones born in future may have severe medical problems .
2976	NoArgument	Would you want to have a clone and not even know ???
2977	NoArgument	These trophoblast cells are destined to become the placenta , the organ that nourishes the growing embryo and , later , the fetus .
2978	NoArgument	" Should A Clone Have Rights ? "
2979	Argument_against	Thus , when it comes to creating a clone of an existing child , Robertson avers that the first child “ may have no right to determine whether or not she is cloned , ” since the child is not herself “ reproducing directly ” — rather , it is her parents who are reproducing by creating a “ later-born identical twin . ”
2980	NoArgument	But it will be a slow process , because one will have to wait about 18 years to see the effect of changes to the genetic code .
2981	Argument_against	Equally important , RESOLVE and its CAMR partners oppose any effort that would allow reproductive cloning , a technique we believe , at this time , is unsafe , irresponsible and unethical .
2982	NoArgument	Of course the cloned individual ’s exceptional intelligence may be due to largely non-genetic factors , and so for a trait like intelligence there will never be certainty about whether the cloned offspring will match their genetic progenitor .
2983	Argument_for	Ms Landrieu does not want to ban cloning research in order to limit medical knowledge .
2984	NoArgument	I do n't mean to be rude or arrogant , just giving my two cents .
2985	NoArgument	Also this helps a lot because I have to write a essay on cloning .
2986	Argument_against	Others feel that the idea of cloning humans is “ playing God . ”
2987	NoArgument	The last argument , specific to cloning , is the spectre of a vast embryo industry .
2988	NoArgument	Macintosh ’s drastic simplification of the Council ’s argument would not be entirely false if the “ unnatural results ” were understood to be the relationships that would exist between the parents and the cloned child .
2989	Argument_against	Ninety-five percent of cloning done have failed in the form of miscarriages , stillbirths and other life-threatening events .
2990	Argument_against	In the upshot , human reproductive cloning is not yet feasible , and indeed there ’s no current prospect that it could be carried out effectively and safely in the foreseeable future .
2991	Argument_against	The appeal of this understanding of the family surely helps explain why most Americans find the idea of human cloning morally repugnant .
2992	Argument_for	Supporters of therapeutic cloning technologies believe that efforts to ban bio-medical research could have an adverse effect for many Americans who hope for access to cures from many diseases .
2993	Argument_against	so i dont think we should make the mistake and go and mess around with nature .
2994	NoArgument	You do n't know what you are talking about - leave it to the professionals .
2995	NoArgument	If you 're wrong , what happens to all of us ?
2996	Argument_against	Cloned human beings may not be considered humans by other people .
2997	Argument_for	However , there is no evidence that identical multiples feel this way , and there does not seem to be anything inherent about sharing a genetic code that compromises individuality ( Elliot , 1998 ) .
2998	Argument_for	Therefore , if parents are not prohibited from procreating on the grounds that they may pass along a severe genetic defect to their children , then it is difficult to deny a set of parents who can only rely on cloning for procreation the chance to do so based on safety reasons alone ( unless the abnormalities that may result from cloning are more severe than the abnormalities that may result from natural conception ) ( Brock , 1997 ) .
2999	Argument_against	[ 35 , 36 ] As summarized by Deirk Ullrich in relation to law in Canada and Germany : " human dignity is an indispensable compass in our continuing journey to promote and protect the rights and freedoms of the individual " .
3000	NoArgument	Embryonic Stem Cells are developed from a female egg after it is fertilized by sperm .
3001	NoArgument	As the report argues , the distinction between therapeutic and reproductive cloning is misleading because the creation of a cloned embryo is always a reproductive act – the embryo is a new organism , the progeny of the source from which it was cloned .
3002	NoArgument	Even if an individual is created with instrumental intentions , if , after the birth of the individual , he/she is treated as an equal member of the community , as an autonomous individual and with respect , is the individual 's dignity still being infringed ?
3003	NoArgument	So , a clone is legally owned by the donor and can be used in what ever way he or she chooses .
3004	NoArgument	Cloning still requires mothers to bear the children to term .
3005	NoArgument	We cloned the Mad region and identified the Mad transcription unit through germline transformation rescue .
3006	Argument_against	The availability of morally acceptable alternatives makes cloning-for-biomedical-research less justifiable .
3007	Argument_for	Curing Disorders Human cloning also has the potential to help cure certain disorders .
3008	Argument_for	Therapeutic cloning is not just a remedy but also a preventive treatment .
3009	Argument_for	At the very least , the argument concludes , SCNT should be allowed for research and therapeutic purposes ( Devolder and Savulescu , 2006 ; American Medical Association , 2003 ; Maas , 2001 ) .
3010	NoArgument	However , the merits of therapeutic cloning were considered on a case-by-case basis within the bioethical guidelines laid down with the approval of the National Bioethical Committee .
3011	NoArgument	God and all the other ma in religions are creation story 's and ways so that we can see life has a meaning and a higher purpouse but it does n't we are just moving along in space like normal elements and particles of dust .
3012	Argument_for	In other words , “ unnatural ” is not synonymous with “ immoral ” ( and conversely , “ natural ” is not synonymous with “ moral ” ) .
3013	NoArgument	Can two people share the one soul ?
3014	Argument_against	Reproductive cloning is considered wrong in so many levels .
3015	Argument_for	Today , parents with children affected by diseases like these may use IVF and PGD to have a child whose cord blood will be a match for their sick child , since one in four siblings will have compatible bone marrow and cord blood .
3016	NoArgument	2 ) I have and will always be a Catholic , but I really do n't have a problem with cloning .
3017	NoArgument	I will , however , endeavor to divine the likely definition of human dignity at play in the context of a given social concern .
3018	NoArgument	Currently , cat and dog cloning experiments for commercial pet sales are only being conducted in South Korea .
3019	Argument_for	If we can play our cards right , cloning might actually be a good thing .
3020	NoArgument	Reproductive cloning , on the other hand , is what you would normally see in sci-fi movies .
3021	Argument_against	Many attempts at animal cloning produced disfigured monsters with severe abnormalities .
3022	NoArgument	A perfectly healthy person , even a perfectly healthy 90-year-old , may nonetheless have genes that give him a relatively high probability of developing certain complex diseases under certain environmental conditions .
3023	NoArgument	To pass a bill requires not 51 votes , but 60 , to override a filibuster .
3024	NoArgument	What is Stem Cell Research ?
3025	Argument_for	Third , the technique could be used to create “ enhanced ” children by cloning an individual considered excellent in some way .
3026	NoArgument	Well get it through your heads because that 's what happened !
3027	Argument_against	Humans should be created through an act of love and not an act of science .
3028	NoArgument	Is this humanities ’ way of trying to replace God ?
3029	Argument_for	The first uses of bone marrow transplantation to treat chronic myeloid leukemia involved identical twins , but doctors soon discovered that siblings , or even unrelated donors with identical human leukocyte antigens , could also provide bone marrow .
3030	Argument_against	Indeed , Dolly 's death , while not definitively traceable to the cloning process , again highlighted the possible health risks associated with reproductive cloning .
3031	Argument_against	This sign of love is lost when a child ’s life begins in a laboratory .
3032	Argument_against	The animals that would be brought back would likely be carrying viruses and illnesses that we are not immune to , or prepared to deal with .
3033	NoArgument	Some pros of cloning plants are cited fairly often .
3034	NoArgument	Human life was sacrosanct , and there was no reason for its violation .
3035	NoArgument	Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori has worked well enough to send countless young men to their deaths through the ages .
3036	Argument_for	Of course , selecting the genome of a child is not a fully reliable way of determining the child ’s biological traits or properties , but it represents an unprecedented level of control : by creating a child with only one genetic parent , cloning allows for exact determination of a child ’s lineage .
3037	Argument_against	BWS entails a larger-than-usual growth pattern and a range of health risks and physical abnormalities .
3038	NoArgument	Let 's say God ( an apple ) made humans ( oranges ) look like him ( oranges that look like an apples ) .
3039	NoArgument	Enter Your Search Terms to Get Started !
3040	Argument_against	Furthermore , there are too many people on this planet now to even consider the vast population increases you are fantasizing about .
3041	Argument_for	Law professor Kerry Lynn Macintosh , in a recent pro-cloning book , exhibits a sound grasp of the science of human cloning and genetics , and rightly argues that two people who share the same DNA will not possess “ the same intellectual , psychological , or behavioral traits . ”
3042	NoArgument	This means that you should know about both the pros and cons .
3043	NoArgument	The initial response to the dramatic Nature article by Wilmut et al. was largely one of fear , mingled with disgust , with too little rational reflection .
3044	NoArgument	Who created the American Flag ?
3045	Argument_against	Norway ’s representative said that his Government opposed both reproductive human cloning and therapeutic cloning , as reflected in its domestic legislation .
3046	NoArgument	I am not of any faith myself , simply because of the fact that there are so many religions in the world with their own ideas of what 's real or not and what/who god is .
3047	Argument_against	Because doctors or scientists are given the power to change a person ’s genetic makeup , it could also mean that mistakes can be made .
3048	Argument_against	Even if a cloned child is not told of his origins , parents will , in the act of specifying their child ’s entire genome , be exercising control over their child ’s origins and identity that will shape the expectations they have for the child that could distort their own openness to the child ’s developing autonomy and aspirations .
3049	NoArgument	Edited by : Louisville : Westminster John Know Press .
3050	Argument_against	As we discussed above , there are serious concerns that the use of cloning technology will result in medically harmful side effects for children , but the chief problem with the idea of transforming reproduction into a manufacturing process is not that this will result in the children being “ flawed . ”
3051	Argument_for	There are no medical reasons for eating chocolates , driving cars , using IVF technology or adopting children , but none of these are prohibited .
3052	NoArgument	Why some people want to clone themselves or even to clone the dead ( and not just cloning pets ) .
3053	Argument_against	The genetic engineering field is infamous for some of the unintended and unforeseen effects of genetic modification , such as the Bt corn ’s harmful effects on the Monarch butterfly .
3054	NoArgument	The issue would now be passed on to the National Parliament .
3055	NoArgument	Ethics involves doing the right thing .
3056	Argument_for	The USA has lagged behind other countries in its policies on assisted reproduction technologies ( ART ) for too long .
3057	NoArgument	But finally crafting a national cloning policy will be an important step toward treating the moral and social issues raised by ART with the seriousness they deserve .
3058	Argument_for	( It ’s not that long ago that IVF was also widely regarded as abhorrent . )
3059	Argument_for	i think if we are smart enough to be able to clone , we are smart enough to figure out a natural , less risky way to solve it .
3060	Argument_for	The new paper , which builds on and confirms a study published last year using a similar technique , resolves technical hurdles along the path to human cloning .
3061	Argument_against	As such , these individuals can not have ordinary , God-given souls .
3062	NoArgument	Would anybody actually propose that the genetically damaged embryo be grown to full term , rather than cloning the existing person ?
3063	Argument_for	In addition to preventing simple genetic diseases , cloning could also be used to reduce the risk of diseases caused by combinations of genetic risk factors .
3064	Argument_against	All knowledge acquired , within research or other arenas , may be used for evil causes in the future - it is impossible to know .
3065	Argument_against	Many opponents fear that the cloning technology could be abused by people with vested interests .
3066	NoArgument	The prohibitions contained in the text could be misunderstood as covering all forms of cloning .
3067	NoArgument	Unfortunately , the counter arguments are rarely reflected in formal policy .
3068	NoArgument	Why should cloning be treated any differently ?
3069	Argument_against	The implications of what happens when human cloning goes wrong are not fully understood , which is not ideal .
3070	Argument_for	Personally , I see nothing wrong with cloning , as long as it 's used in the right parameters .
3071	NoArgument	CAMR notes that one renowned diabetes researcher has already left for Britain , ostensibly because of the mere threat of a ban .
3072	NoArgument	However , those with the highest levels of education and income are somewhat more supportive of cloning , and actually give majority support to the cloning of animals .
3073	NoArgument	( 6 ) Although non-mammalian cloning was achieved in 1952 , mankind had to wait another 44 years until he was finally cloned the first mammal .
3074	NoArgument	This is typically done just days after conception or between the 5th and 9th week .
3075	NoArgument	If you 're religious and say that only God gives us the right to be healthy or not etc , then I would be slightly appalled but I respect your opinion .
3076	NoArgument	Once activated , the cancer cells will divide rapidly and will not respond to the natural cell signaling process of a human body .
3077	NoArgument	There is n’t a massive egg bank right now which is why this type of medical procedure is stunted and is unlikely to become very commonplace in the near future .
3078	Argument_for	Just as each member of a pair of identical twins has a soul , so would a clone .
3079	Argument_for	Moreover , even if there were a detriment , it is unclear whether that would be a result of society ’s prejudice and fear of human cloning , or a result that inherently comes with being a clone .
3080	Argument_for	Reproductive cloning helps people fulfill their dreams of having children .
3081	NoArgument	Couples typically submit to four cycles of costly treatment before producing a child .
3082	Argument_against	Rarely do domestic or international instruments provide an operational definition of human dignity and there is rarely an explanation of how , exactly , dignity is infringed in the context reproductive cloning .
3083	NoArgument	Leave this field blank
3084	Argument_against	The technique is extremely risky right now .
3085	Argument_for	I feel like cloning is a very good thing in the livestock side of things .
3086	NoArgument	So He does n't do bad things ; he puts people in our lives because they will teach us something that we may not know at the time or even ever know or realize .
3087	NoArgument	Of course , not all of those who find aspects of this vision of the family appealing endorse or even approve of cloning-to-produce-children .
3088	Argument_against	The science of human cloning is not well known as of right now .
3089	Argument_against	The other foetuses were hideously deformed and either died or were aborted .
3090	NoArgument	Thirty-five percent of Americans said religious beliefs had the biggest influence , followed by the media at 21 % , and education on the subject at 19 % .
3091	Argument_for	However , the main difference is that the birth of human twins is seen as a natural practice , but human cloning is seen as artificial in nature .
3092	Argument_against	As noted by Pattinson , the act of cloning could be implicated in an intention to " violate the rights of the clone in the future . "
3093	Argument_for	Rather , it is aimed at “ ending reproductive roulette , ” or progressing from “ chance to choice ” or from “ chance to purpose , ” to borrow from the titles of three books .
3094	Argument_against	Our position is that the repugnance most people feel at the idea of human cloning is justified , if in need of articulation and clarification .
3095	Argument_against	In the real world , it still remains experimental and comes with a lot of scientific limitations .
3096	NoArgument	He or she will grow in an environment different from that of the clone , with different experiences and opportunities .
3097	Argument_against	In fact , living longer is already causing social problems in the world today , so to artificially extend everybody ’s time on Earth might cause even more problems further down the line , problems that we can not possibly predict .
3098	NoArgument	( The prospect of cloning being used in combination with other genetic engineering techniques is discussed in detail in Part Three . )
3099	Argument_against	Parents will suffer identity problems trying to raise a clone .
3100	NoArgument	For example , shortly after the birth of Dolly Sir John Polkinghorne noted that " [ o ] ne of the by-products of the furor about Dolly has been to remind thoughtful people of the poverty and implausibility of a genetic reductionist account of human nature " .
3101	Argument_against	With such minor effects , it would be difficult to justify the risks and expense of intervening to modify particular genes to improve a trait like intelligence .
3102	Argument_against	Cloning distorts the cloned person 's sense of individuality and social identity .
3103	NoArgument	Allow me to explain .
3104	NoArgument	F ) What are the cons of cloning ?
3105	NoArgument	Almost everything under the sun has both positives and negatives .
3106	NoArgument	Unbearable emotional pressures on a teenager trying to establish his or her identity .
3107	Argument_against	Therapeutic cloning is expensive and it is certainly beyond the realm of affordability for most people .
3108	NoArgument	Death – death can happen when the donor egg ’s mitochondria does n’t match with the somatic cell ’s mitochondria 3 .
3109	NoArgument	Immortality is just around the corner for those who can afford it .
3110	Argument_against	Exploitation It is also not known completely if human cloning might eventually be used to exploit people for the vested interests of others .
3111	Argument_against	Like the person who wrote this essay said , if you use cloning , and eventually get rid of the diversity , our unpredictability of viruses and bacteria evolving will come back and slap us in the face .
3112	NoArgument	This is my imput on the subject .
3113	NoArgument	Comparisons with identical twins likewise obscure the most important relationship between the person being cloned and the cloned child : the child may be genetically an identical twin , but is generationally a child , a son or a daughter .
3114	Argument_against	It is playing God for us to interfere in this way with the reproductive process .
3115	NoArgument	There is a certain technical sense in which this is true — the origin of the cloned child ’s genome will have been the sexual reproduction of the cell donor ’s parents .
3116	NoArgument	But without knowing that these " other arguments " are , it is impossible to have an informed policy discussion .
3117	Argument_for	Furthermore , we should be very wary of banning something without being able to say why it is wrong .
3118	Argument_against	Today ’s Declaration was only a stepping stone in the process towards a convention on a complete ban on human cloning .
3119	Argument_for	Indeed , many argue that it would be morally impermissible to bring a child into the world who suffers , even if the child ’s life has a net value that renders it worth living ( Steinbock and McClamrock , 1994 ) .
3120	NoArgument	However , advocates of eugenic enhancement have never entirely disappeared , and their influence in bioethics is arguably not waning , but waxing .
3121	Argument_against	Remember guys that life is not cruel , its the people who try to control the natural process of life that make it cruel .
3122	Argument_for	" Who among us would want to take that risk of bringing someone into this world that would be defective ? "
3123	Argument_for	If reproductive cloning is perfected , a quadriplegic can also choose to have himself cloned , so someone can take his place .

3125	Argument_for	One study found that children born from IVF and DI ( donor insemination ) are faring as well as children born via natural conception .
3126	Argument_against	Moreover , dignity is connected to human " uniqueness , " though it is rarely explained why this is so .
3127	Argument_against	Gilbert Meilaender notes that we " find asexual reproduction only in the lowest forms of life .
3128	NoArgument	This is no different for human cloning .

3130	Argument_against	It is fair to say that cloning is akin to murder or manslaughter at the least .
3131	NoArgument	In this image of the family , moral duties arise from the natural relationship of parents to children , duties that are not autonomously chosen or made in contracts .

3142	Argument_against	Reproductive cloning creates a lack of diversity within the human population .
3143	Argument_against	However , as we stated above , the chief moral problems with cloning-to-produce-children are not with the cloned children themselves , but with the effects that the act of cloning will have on the relationship between the generations .
3144	NoArgument	No Asian couple would choose the stereotypical Western child either .

3181	Argument_against	According to the May 2001 Gallup poll , the vast majority of Americans , across almost all demographic subgroups , oppose human cloning .
3182	NoArgument	I say individual because the cloned human would be a person too , it may be a genetic copy of someone else , but will be an entirely different person with as many similiarities as identical twins .
3183	Argument_against	Individuals will be able to have a child for the sake of having children , or as a symbol of status , rather than because they desire to conceive , love and raise another human being .
3184	Argument_for	Again , people may have nefarious motivations for using cloning – just as they may have questionable reasons for using IVF or having children the natural way – but aside from religious arguments regarding the moral status of the embryo and the significance of sexual union , there seems to be little to support the notion that " replication " infringes human dignity .
3185	Argument_against	The Council of Europe 's Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and its Additional Protocol on the Prohibition of Cloning Human Beings states that : " the instrumentalization of human beings through the deliberate creation of genetically identical human beings is contrary to human dignity and thus constitutes a misuse of biology and medicine " .

3221	NoArgument	Why do we put the " religious " aspect on this ?
3222	Argument_against	Cost is an issue too , and it would be hard to know if a health insurance company would pay for a person to have an organ cloned , or if these prices would be so prohibitive as to make the process unaffordable or available only to a few .
3223	NoArgument	Time to talk about cloning ?

3230	Argument_for	Having a cloned organ would mean no rejection of the organ from you body .
3231	Argument_for	Second , if one accepts that our genes do not determine our life course or who we are as individuals , it is unclear how the technical act of cloning is more problematic , in relation to instrumentalism , than having children through IVF or , for that matter , making children the natural way for the sole purpose of producing an heir , labour or a means of old age support .
3232	NoArgument	Lailah , I am only 13 but i think that your opinon was amazing .

3487	Argument_against	I also think it 's funny that a lot of people have brought up " super children " and " we are gods " , yet no one has even mentioned Mary Shelley 's book , " Frankenstein . "
3488	NoArgument	How is that " wrong " ?
3489	NoArgument	November 1 , 2001 - " In the case of reproductive cloning the engendered child would be brought to term and delivered without the benefit of parents since it would carry the genetic code only of the one who had supplied the DNA from his or her somatic cell .

3493	NoArgument	Countries with strict standards have legally banned research on reproductive human cloning , but give leeway to therapeutic cloning .
3494	Argument_against	Often clones do n't live as long as sexually reproduced animals , possibly because the genes taken from adults are more likely to have undergone mutations .
3495	Argument_against	But even if cloning offers some advantages over iPS cells , the availability of a comparable alternative weakens the case for permitting cloning .
3496	Argument_for	There would be no fear of ‘ accidental cloning ’ that could bring a child to a parent who was unprepared , or unwilling , to love it .
3497	Argument_against	We recoil at the idea of growing human beings for spare body parts or creating life for our convenience .... Even the most noble ends do not justify any means . "

3507	NoArgument	One issue when discussing this matter is the different types of things cloned .
3508	Argument_against	As things were headed becoming better by the appearance of a human clone , a major problem has become " human cloning prohibition act " in 2009 , which has labeled as cloning illegal , immoral , not unethical activity .
3509	NoArgument	Reproductive cloning can give a new meaning to genetic modification .
3510	Argument_for	If such parents are not deprived of their opportunity to have children out of concern that they will violate their child ’s right to an open future , then we seem hard pressed to find a reason to deprive couples who would turn to cloning for reproductive purposes of a similar opportunity .
3511	NoArgument	Some have sought to articulate the moral insights about human procreation and the meaning of the family that concerns about cloning might intimate .

3540	NoArgument	There are a number of very real and very troubling concerns surrounding genetic engineering , although there are also some very real benefits to further genetic engineering and genetic research , too .
3541	NoArgument	For instance , if both members of a couple know , as a result of genetic testing or from their family history , that they each carry a single copy of the same recessive gene for Tay-Sachs disease , then there will be a one-in-four chance that any child the couple naturally conceives will inherit the recessive gene from both parents , and therefore have the disease .

3569	Argument_against	As for spare parts , it would be no more ethical to use a clone for that purpose than it would be to use your next door neighbor .
3570	NoArgument	If God created us in his own image and we are cloning people or anything then they ( the clone ) is created in the image of man or something else .
3571	Argument_for	Why should we allow one religion to dictate the rules over everyone ?
3572	NoArgument	From a policy perspective , it is worth noting that a variety of commentators have long questioned the deterministic argument that underlies the autonomy/uniqueness concern about reproductive cloning .
3573	Argument_for	So , this goes without saying the human cloning can help athletes heal faster , be it a torn ACL or a life-threatening condition .
3574	NoArgument	The representative of India expressed deep regret that the Sixth Committee had been unable to recommend to the plenary a text that was acceptable to all Member States on a matter of such paramount importance as an international convention against the reproductive cloning of human beings .

3576	Argument_for	When there is any suspicion of irregular cellular activity or someone is vulnerable to particular kinds of medical problems , therapeutic cloning can be used to replace those damaged cells or tissues .
3577	NoArgument	Lines and paragraphs break automatically .
3578	Argument_against	The most important part of a person is their spirit , soul or mind and cloning does not allow one to achieve this , it rather allows one to attempt to achieve some genetic standard .
3579	Argument_for	Among these is the possibility of cloning parts of humans , like vital organs to be used in transplants , which would be likely to nullify organ rejection issues .
3580	NoArgument	Rather , the real question is whether new technologies like reproduction by somatic cell nuclear transfer are presumptively morally wrong or presumptively morally right .
3581	NoArgument	The ad hoc application of human dignity in relation to human cloning will undoubtedly impact how it is applied to future technologies .
3582	Argument_for	One response to the “ unnatural ” objection is similar to the first response to the “ playing God ” objection ; most everything humans do , from medicine to modern forms of sanitation , are “ unnatural ” , and most are not considered morally objectionable as a consequence .
3583	Argument_for	Cloning a human is a very personal and emotional decision , but that does n't mean cloning itself is an abomination .
3584	Argument_against	Cloning is a break from the natural process of evolution , which is known to strengthen species and improves their survival instincts through diversity .
3585	NoArgument	We rightly value our freedom to seek a “ social state ” other than that of our parents , but the obligations of love and support that parents owe to their children and the obligations of honor and respect that children owe to their parents remain truly obligatory , not matters of free choice .
3586	Argument_against	However , since the product of human cloning is a human embryo , using cloning to produce tissues or organs directly rather than producing “ an entire individual ” ignores the fact that the product of human cloning already is “ an entire individual , ” and manipulating its development to transform it into specific tissues would amount to killing it .
3587	Argument_against	The representative of Canada , emphasizing that his country ’s position was clear , said reproductive cloning was illegal in Canada in whatever form .

3594	Argument_against	It is a process of replication of genetic constitution , so preventing gene diversity .
3595	NoArgument	As such , policy makers can safely use the concept of human dignity to reflect general unspecified condemnation .
3596	Argument_against	Genetic modification involves daunting scientific and technical challenges ; it offers the potential of only marginal improvements in complex traits , and it holds out the risk of unpredictable side effects and consequences .
3597	Argument_against	By genetically engineering our species , however , we will be having a detrimental effect on our genetic diversity in the same way as something like cloning would .
3598	Argument_for	It has the ability to completely transform and alter the way that many diseases and disorders are treated .
3599	Argument_against	It is a human experiment doomed to failure because the child will NOT be identical in every way , despite the hopes of the parents .
3600	NoArgument	Everyone should just let things happen as they do .
3601	Argument_for	Unlike cloning-to-produce-children , which would be pursued only by those with a distorted understanding of the goods of procreation and family , cloning-for-biomedical-research serves a noble aim — the discovery of new knowledge that might make possible new modes of healing .
3602	Argument_for	It is unclear how , exactly , the asexual nature of the process , on its own , is problematic from the perspective of human dignity .
3603	Argument_for	Creating stem cells from a cloned embryo presumably would create tissues that would n't be rejected by the person who donated skin cells initially .
3604	Argument_against	He goes on to note , however , that in such circumstances , " it is not the cloning as such that violates the clone 's rights , but the intention to make the clone worse off ( relative to its alternatives ) in the future " .
3605	NoArgument	Sometimes this brings us benefits , but many times it cripples us .
3606	NoArgument	He had voted against the Declaration , since it did not reflect the views of all States and did not enjoy consensus .
3607	Argument_against	Reduces a sense of individuality .
3608	Argument_against	Will human cloning reduce genetic diversity ?
3609	Argument_for	Or , perhaps one of the prospective parents is predisposed to certain genetic disorders and , in order to completely avoid their offspring inheriting these disorders , they decide to clone the other prospective parent .
3610	Argument_against	This could lead to a set of problems that we have no ability to handle .
3611	Argument_for	Rather , the intent is to use the cells of the embryo in order to further research that may ultimately lead to treatments or cures for certain afflictions .
3612	Argument_for	However , Americans do seem to favor cloning that creates human cells to aid in medical research for disease treatment , just so long as it does not create new human beings .
3613	Argument_for	So when Martha Nussbaum and others note that there are many activities that are commonly thought to be disgusting but that are nonetheless morally acceptable , this has little bearing on whether a sense of repugnance should be taken seriously , because while colonoscopies may commonly be considered disgusting , no one finds them repugnant .
3614	Argument_for	Therapeutic cloning may remain in the experimental phase or just as a rare specialization for some time .
3615	Argument_against	With our No Pet Cloning campaign , AAVS seeks to protect both animals and people from harm and exploitation .

3620	NoArgument	The new paper is more important scientifically than practically , Jaenisch said .
3621	Argument_against	Failure of Human Cloning Others that are opposed to human cloning feel that it is a mute debate since human cloning is primarily unsuccessful .
3622	Argument_for	The debate over cloning-to-produce-children is chiefly a debate about a moral vision of the family that is increasingly widely held , one in which reproduction is seen as a freely chosen project of autonomous adults .
3623	Argument_against	But there are more realistic , and less obviously unethical , applications of cloning to create genetically matched cells and tissues .

3638	NoArgument	Would n't God want us to save our people ?
3639	NoArgument	Whether it has been naturally or artificially reduced is not the point .
3640	Argument_for	Cloning does not necessarily entail the creation of “ designer ” children because cloning recreates a pre-existing DNA ; it does not involve modifying or enhancing DNA in order to produce a child with certain desired traits .
3641	Argument_for	We already play god ; curing diseases , hospitals , reviving people who die of heart attacks , implanting embryos , etc .
3642	NoArgument	The ambiguity of the Declaration might give rise to certain political and other concerns .
3643	NoArgument	Do other humans have full individuality ?
3644	NoArgument	Even if you had a good point with cited sources that back up your claim , you portray yourself as an uneducated teenager without the skills to research such a complicated topic ( which I do not believe is the case as you would n't be reading an article about this to begin with ) .
3645	NoArgument	As the desire of Buchanan ’s student suggests , this radical transformation of the meaning of the relationship between the generations would not be an unintended consequence of the use of cloning , but would in many cases be the aim of those using the technology .

3669	Argument_against	We humans are an amazingly resourceful species , but while this helped us to survive all sorts of devastations in the past we should stop at a certain point .
3670	NoArgument	So is reproductive cloning is good or bad ?

3692	NoArgument	To some extent , however , all of this is moot .
3693	Argument_for	Since the idea of human cloning came out , cloning techniques have been continuously developed , taking basic understanding of developmental human biology to many different levels .
3694	Argument_against	However , there is a more serious , less cartoonish objection to turning procreation into manufacturing .
3695	NoArgument	To believe otherwise is to adopt a deterministic view of the role of genes that is simply wrong .
3696	NoArgument	Legal contracts allow prospective parents to choose which individuals with which biological relationships will be considered the child ’s parents ( whether a particular woman is a “ surrogate ” or the recipient of a “ donor embryo ” is a matter of choice , not biology ) .
3697	Argument_against	Opponents of the cloning say that this technology questions God ’s role and existence .
3698	Argument_against	Rather , in this paper I argue that the lack of thoughtful policy analysis of the role of human dignity hurts the broader public debate about reproductive cloning , trivializes the potential value of human dignity as a normative principle and makes it nearly impossible to critique the actual justifications behind many of the proposed policies .
3699	Argument_for	The new moral image of the family , based on a doctrine of reproductive liberty , is an appealing one for a liberal society .

3707	Argument_for	Even organ cloning would be incredibly helpful to humans as a species , if you could clone healthy heart or liver cells and implant them into the heart or liver of the person who gave the healthy , but needed the cloned ones to cure a disease or just an injury , they could live longer , because of a few cloned cells .
3708	NoArgument	They 'd be nothing less than a younger identical twin .
3709	Argument_against	But the difference between cloned children and twins is not in the information that the clone might receive about his genetic traits , but in the ways that the act of cloning will shape the expectations surrounding his life , especially the expectations of his parents .

3736	Argument_for	Agriculture and Drug Production : Not only can the best traits be perpetuated but farm animals could also be used as ï ¿ ½ machinesï ¿ ½ for large-scale production of medically important proteins .
3737	Argument_for	But if one 's genetic make up is not a key feature to our autonomy and moral thought , and few could genuinely claim that it is , then a central plank of this concern is lost .
3738	Argument_against	just image if someone came up to you and asked you who the father is , and you would have to say noone , just image how painful that would be for you just to say .
3739	NoArgument	Could the research be misused in the future or not ?
3740	Argument_against	As far as humans go , I do n't think it is okay to clone somebody else .

3848	NoArgument	It is tied between the number of pros and cons .
3849	Argument_for	If one were to take a skeptical view of the policy making process , it would not be hard to conclude that concern for human dignity is used as a justification for cloning laws precisely because the notion of human dignity is both so revered and so ill-defined .

4236	Argument_for	It could prevent the natural grieving process that humans have because a person tragically lost could just be cloned once again .
4237	Argument_against	What about all the disfigured and highly abnormal clones that either spontaneously aborted or were destroyed / terminated by scientists worried about the horrors they might be creating .
4238	Argument_for	Infertility could be eliminated .
4239	Argument_for	But these technologies can also dramatically expand the range of choices individuals can make about reproduction — allowing single individuals to have children without involving a husband or wife , or allowing couples or individuals to choose to have children who will possess a specific set of genetic properties by using DNA from some exceptional individual .

4244	NoArgument	The symptoms of LOS are somewhat similar to Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome ( BWS ) in humans .
4245	NoArgument	Everybody who intentionally conceives a child does so for a reason , whether it is to raise a child to love and nurture , propagate their genes , support themselves in their old age , bear a child on a significant date ( for example 1 January 2000 ) , conform to peer or parental pressure , or mistakenly help save a marriage .
4246	NoArgument	There are two types of cloning : so-called therapeutic cloning and reproductive cloning .
4247	NoArgument	Human cloning is the main process by which a genetically identical copy of a certain bacteria , plant or animal is produced by asexual reproduction .
4248	Argument_for	In 2001 , IVF pioneer Robert Edwards compared criticism he had received in the 1970s to the criticism being leveled at human cloning , and argued that eventually cloning could come to be accepted as an infertility treatment just as IVF has been .
4249	NoArgument	I , like several people so far , am using this site as a source for a report that I am doing .
4250	Argument_against	Other statements simply assert that " the production of identical human individuals " or the creation of a " genetic ' copy " ' should be banned .
4251	Argument_for	The fact that cells can be turned into embryonic ones and then made into embryos has been published , Jaenisch said , but it 's always useful in science to show that results can be repeated .
4252	Argument_against	Older individuals will have shorter telomeres and a higher chance of having accumulated mutations in their somatic cells , and will likely have cells that will be more difficult to “ reprogram ” through cloning .
4253	Argument_against	Also Anon 34 brought up an excellent point when he mentioned that creating a bug-resistant plant ( s ) could lead to the extinction of that bug , causing a butterfly effect .
4254	NoArgument	Hopefully , the National Parliament would take the necessary action , as the letter and spirit of the Declaration were in step with Mexican legislation and jurisprudence .

4274	NoArgument	By doing so , transparency in policy making is obscured or even lost .
4275	Argument_against	Though this student is right that IVF poses some serious dangers to women and children , these risks are hardly good reasons to use human cloning , since any remotely plausible cloning technology would involve the same risks to the mother , and would almost certainly pose more serious risks to the future child .
4276	Argument_for	When a child is cloned to produce matching tissues that can be used to treat a particular health condition , then human cloning would be the next best thing to the discovery of technologies that has forever changed human life .
4277	NoArgument	That 's my opinion anyway .
4278	Argument_for	Animals like the Wooly Mammoth , Tasmanian Tiger , and yes , even dinosaurs , could once again roam the earth .

4284	Argument_for	With genetic engineering , on the other hand , we could reverse some of the most basic reasons for the body ’s natural decline on a cellular level , drastically improving both the span of our lives and the quality of life later on .
4285	Argument_for	Since , presumably , a clone would still be a person and an autonomous rational being , a clone would certainly retain her human dignity ( Glannon , 2005 ; Elliot , 1998 ) .
4286	Argument_for	There are many diseases that can be prevented or at least controlled with the help of therapeutic cloning .

4297	NoArgument	Many countries have banned research on reproductive cloning .
4298	Argument_for	More importantly , given Meilaender ’s concern that the quality of parenting is compromised in tandem with the artificiality of conception , the study found that “ the quality of parenting in families with a child conceived by assisted conception is superior to that shown by families with a naturally conceived child , even when gamete donation is used in the child 's conception ” ( Golombok et al. , 1995 , 295 ; also see Golombok , 2003 and Golombok et al. , 2001 ) .
4299	NoArgument	A cloned disk or drive contains all the partitions from the source disk or drive .
4300	Argument_for	For example , a couple may be able to generate only a few embryos from IVF procedures ; cloning via artificially induced twinning would increase the number of embryos to a quantity that is more likely to result in a live birth .

4305	NoArgument	Disks and Drives : To backup or clone ?
4306	NoArgument	Although some states have prohibited human cloning ( with some prohibiting only cloning-to-produce-children while others prohibit all forms of cloning ) , at the federal level cloning remains largely unregulated , largely because the controversy over whether to prohibit only cloning-to-produce-children or to pass a comprehensive cloning ban has stymied national legislative action .
4307	NoArgument	But this would be blasfomouse would n't it ?
4308	Argument_for	Yet , we can look towards the children who are products of modern day artificial reproduction in order to see that such a concern is not supported by the evidence .

4353	Argument_for	Therapeutic cloning can help in rejuvenating cellular generation and growth .
4354	Argument_for	If a cloned child would not experience any less confusion than a child in such a situation , then we would be hard pressed to show why the prospective parents of the former ought to be denied the opportunity to have a genetically related child based on these grounds alone ( Harris , 2004 ) .
4355	Argument_for	As long as the cloned child has a life that , despite her genetic defect , is still worth living , then it would still be permissible to use cloning to bring her into being ( Lane , 2006 ) .
4356	Argument_against	Clones that are not treated as humans can lead to division and unrest .
4357	Argument_against	Some critics fear that children created via SCNT would be subjected to unfair expectations of duplicating the talents and achievements of whoever provided their nuclear DNA .
4358	NoArgument	No problem , save it as a course and come back to it later .

4398	Argument_against	In cloning-for-biomedical-research , the act of human reproduction is transformed entirely into a means of satisfying the desires and furthering the projects of autonomous adults , in complete indifference to the interests of the new human beings created .
4399	Argument_against	Human DNA can be contaminated and the chances o success are very rare .
4400	Argument_against	While the difference in age between a cloned child and the person from whom he is cloned is the most obvious reason the two will not have identical biological or psychological properties , this difference in age is also the reason why cloned children will face challenges in forming their own sense of individuality and identity .
4401	Argument_against	Scientists do not yet know absolutely everything about the way that the human body works ( although they do , of course , have a very good idea ) .

4445	Argument_against	And of course cloned children could decide one day to clone themselves in turn , further separating the technical sense of genetic parenthood from any actual relationship between the generations .
4446	Argument_for	Medical advancements once feared are now accepted ; cloning is the same .
4447	Argument_for	The purpose of using clonal embryos via SCNT technology to generate stem cells is to allow creation of tissues or organs that the clonal donor can use without having these tissues or organs rejected by their body 's immune system .
4448	NoArgument	What are the Pros and Cons of Cloning ?
4449	NoArgument	But a similar charge could be levied against the banners , who include both the religious right and left-wing Luddites .
4450	NoArgument	In a February 2001 Time/CNN poll , 45 % of Americans think it will be possible to create human clones in the next 10 years , while 23 % say in 20 years , and 10 % say in 50 years .
4451	Argument_against	According to some scientists , the cloning technology used today is not yet ready to be tested on humans , which makes reproductive cloning a very risky endeavor .
4452	Argument_against	More than any other reproductive technology , cloning would undermine the “ giftedness ” of children , and because there are so few substantive reasons for using cloning-to-produce-children — cloning is more likely to cause harm to babies than to ensure their health — moral approval for cloning represents an extreme commitment to reproductive autonomy for its own sake .
4453	NoArgument	Unfortunately , " genetic determinism " is a much more challenging and amorphous policy target as compared with human cloning technology .
4454	NoArgument	Our planet takes up such a tiny part of the universe and so many things could kill us off .
4455	NoArgument	i disagree with this because death is not a belief , but a fact .
4456	NoArgument	Reproductive technologies increasingly allow parents to choose and control the kind of biological relationship they will have with their children .
4457	NoArgument	One of our editors will review your suggestion and make changes if warranted .
4458	NoArgument	Dolly , was developed by a team of scientists at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh , Scotland .
4459	NoArgument	I also think that on the " God " issue that this would be a real test .
4460	Argument_against	The mother 's body may reject the implanting embryo .
4461	NoArgument	NEW COURSE : Get Top Grades !
4462	NoArgument	When you clone a person , it means that his genetic attributes are also duplicated .
4463	NoArgument	Medically , human reproductive cloning is seen as a possible means of child bearing for some infertile couples , though not without its fair share of criticisms , mostly because of the low success rate and the possibility of hundreds of ' flawed embryos ' being discarded in the process .
4464	Argument_against	Macintosh argues that when cloning critics talk about cloning as manufacture , they open the door to stigmatizing and dehumanizing the children created through cloning .
4465	Argument_for	From the professional athlete who tears their ACL to the person who becomes a quadriplegic because of a devastating automobile accident , recovery times could be lowered and true healing could occur thanks to the cloning of their own cells to help the recovery process .
4466	Argument_for	But some defenders of human cloning argue that a clone would indeed have two genetic parents — the two genetic parents of the person whose somatic cell nuclei were used for the cloning procedure .
4467	Argument_for	It will not only revive animal and plant population , but also offer potential benefits to humans .
4468	NoArgument	This is perhaps the biggest “ con ” to cloning , and the one most frequently cited .
4469	NoArgument	Today ’s vote reflected the wide divergence in the international community on the text .
4470	NoArgument	There is no god to test us or try us .
4471	NoArgument	By contrast , many scientists , ethicists , and advocates use the term “ cloning ” for both practices — calling one “ therapeutic cloning ” and the other “ reproductive cloning . ”
4472	Argument_for	His world outlook would have nothing in common with Hitler , and even if we force-fed him the same ideology there would be no guarantee he would accept it . "
4473	NoArgument	As it seems to me , calmer voices eventually won the academic debate .
4474	NoArgument	Maybe it is a good thing and maybe it is not .
4475	NoArgument	However , therapeutic cloning ( for stem cells ) is a matter of starting the reproductive process and then killing off the embryo so that stem cells can be collected .
4476	Argument_for	What at first seems unthinkable might turn out to be a blessing for some or a possibility for many . "
4477	NoArgument	But any given gene seems to have only a tiny effect on intelligence ; one recent study looking at several genes associated with intelligence found that they each accounted for only about 0.3 points of IQ .
4478	NoArgument	When it comes to playing God , stem cell research might be more of a problem .
4479	NoArgument	Death of the first cloned mammal , was followed by a lively debate related issues / ethical aspects of cloning , debate that continues today .

4482	NoArgument	It has no trajectory to becoming a human being ; it will never be implanted in a woman 's uterus .
4483	Argument_against	And , of course , there are the clear health and safety issues that are far from being resolved .
4484	NoArgument	A Gallup poll conducted in May found 88 % of Americans saying human cloning should not be allowed if it ever becomes possible .
4485	NoArgument	There are court precedents though ; a cancer cell line was developed and very profitable to a pharmaceutical laboratory and the lawsuit that the patient brought to bear was heard and the result ?
4486	Argument_against	The notion that it is impossible for science to answer the question of when human life begins , or even that the question is meaningless , can be convenient for scientists who want to use embryos as raw materials in their technological projects , but it also represents an abdication of the responsibility of science to provide us not only with technological power over nature but also with answers to questions about nature , including answers that might make us reconsider the moral implications of some of our growing technological power over nature .
4487	Argument_against	Even in animals , cloning remains challenging , with most clones showing abnormalities and dying early ; and human cloning would be far more difficult , he said .
4488	Argument_for	Therefore , a child born with mental , physical or developmental impairments is not made worse off by being brought into existence .
4489	Argument_for	In case of organ transplants , many patients suffer worsening symptoms and may not even be alive by the time the organ becomes available .
4490	Argument_against	Rather , they are anxious to create a brand of humans with whom they can experiment .
4491	NoArgument	Which leads to different personalities .
4492	Argument_against	This would be very bad for the animals because they would not be able to thrive in a natural environment .
4493	Argument_for	If cloning were to be legal it would be a choice , an option , so if you 're against it , fine it wo n't affect you if you choose for it not to .
4494	Argument_against	Rather than taking “ already-codified moral doctrines ” as the starting point and evaluating both cloning and the moral reactions against cloning in terms of these doctrines , Putnam took seriously the spontaneous moral horror at the idea of cloning , and by reflecting on its meaning , articulated the sense in which cloning would distort the “ moral image ” of the family .
4495	Argument_against	There is also the question of whether clones receive souls or not .
4496	Argument_for	The latest CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll shows that a majority of Americans , 54 % , support " cloning that is not designed to specifically result in the birth of a human being , but is designed to aid medical research that might find treatment for diseases . "
4497	Argument_against	If he wanted humans interfering in the creation of humans he would ask for it .
4498	Argument_against	Reproductive cloning could create a division among people .
4499	Argument_against	Potentially turns humans into a commodity .
4500	Argument_against	This is an unacceptable infringement of the liberty and autonomy that we grant to every human person .
4501	NoArgument	They will not be daily compared to a physically identical individual , as there will be a gap between their ages , and hence psychological and physical characteristics , of tens of years .
4502	Argument_for	What it probably does have is the potential for the cure of diseases affecting millions of people . ”
4503	NoArgument	If cloning technology improves and scientific evidence comes to show that cloning may be performed with less risk to children , then safety may come to be a less important part of the debate over cloning .
4504	Argument_against	He stressed that human cloning was unethical and a direct assault on human dignity .
4505	NoArgument	Though some of these fears may have an element of truth , they are all exaggerated .
4506	NoArgument	Steve Paulson recently sat down with Savulescu to talk some of these hot-button issues , from eugenics to human cloning .
4507	NoArgument	We think SCNT can produce some very special cells , but not yet a child .
4508	Argument_for	Studying regeneration of organs , solutions to conditions like diabetes and Parkinson ’s are becoming a realm of possibility with the help of therapeutic cloning .
4509	NoArgument	Over the past twenty years , we have enjoyed success in cloning many mammalian species , but no one has cloned a human being .
4510	Argument_against	Unlike identical twins , who grow up simultaneously , the cloned child ’s elder “ twin ” will stand as a kind of genetic prophecy , and a source of expectations for how the younger child ’s life might turn out , even in the unlikely event that those expectations had nothing to do with the choice to produce a clone in the first place .
4511	Argument_against	Only 1 % of animal cloning made so far have had a positive result , but most of them have suffered serious disorders .
4512	NoArgument	I do n't think so , but I am not sure .
4513	Argument_against	Religious beliefs are the main reason for opposition to cloning , according to a February 2001 Time/CNN poll .
4514	Argument_for	Because the fruitfulness of natural procreation is not entirely under the control of the would-be parents , hope is the attitude cultivated in couples toward the prospect of children .
4515	Argument_for	If a couple used a sperm or egg donor who is not a Tay-Sachs carrier ( which can be ascertained through relatively simple genetic testing ) , the couple could be sure that their child would not be affected by the disease .
4516	Argument_against	Creating human embryos with the express purpose of destroying them is even more problematic than the incidental destruction of embryos that occurs during IVF or the destruction of ' left-over ' embryos in other forms of stem-cell research , making it very controversial for the US public .
4517	Argument_against	Researchers in England and Australia have already backed proposals to create human-animal hybrids , for example by fusing a human cell to an animal egg to create embryos that are 99.9 percent human and 0.1 percent rabbit .4 People are concerned that cloning represents a dangerous ' transgression ' of science .5 Unnatural acts Many also feel that cloning is ï ¿ ½ not naturalï ¿ ½ because , overall , cloning requires a significantly greater level of involvement and interference with animalsï ¿ ½ reproductive performance than conventional production methods .
4518	NoArgument	Is human cloning compromises human dignity ?
4519	Argument_against	Could Saddam Hussein clone an army ?
4520	NoArgument	Before you come to your own conclusion on the topic of human cloning , it is always a wise idea to be fully informed on both sides of the issue .
4521	Argument_against	The bill would make cloning human cells a federal crime , punishable by up to ten years in jail and fines of $ 1m .
4522	Argument_for	Some cloning already exists , and more is likely to as science continues to develop this technology .
4523	NoArgument	This image of the family was perhaps most evocatively expressed in the Supreme Court ’s 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey ruling , which extolled the importance of every individual being able to “ define one ’s own concept of existence , of meaning , of the universe , and of the mystery of human life ” through access to technologies and techniques that add to their reproductive autonomy ( in that particular case , abortion ) .
4524	NoArgument	You 've ended my four day lengthy hunt !
4525	NoArgument	But we can not say .
4526	NoArgument	I discussed two types of human cloning : therapeutic cloning and reproductive cloning .
4527	Argument_for	There are a number of genetic mutations that humans can suffer from that will probably never be ended unless we actively intervene and genetically engineer the next generation to withstand these problems .
4528	NoArgument	Since religion comes into play on the topic of human cloning this can lead to very passionate opinions that are emotional and not necessarily based on fact .
4529	NoArgument	It is also an example of how critics and debate can lead to significant improvements for both sides .
4530	Argument_for	Similarly , objecting to cloning on the grounds that embryos are sacrificed in order to achieve a live birth is only a valid objection if the number of embryos lost are greater in cloning than in natural reproduction .
4531	Argument_for	He says we have a moral obligation to use new technology to create the best possible children .
4532	Argument_for	To be more extreme , almost everything humans engage in , from wearing clothing , to using phones and computers , to indoor plumbing , all , in some sense , interfere with some aspect of nature .
4533	Argument_for	Reproductive cloning could aid in genetic research .
4534	NoArgument	An example is hip displasia in purebred dogs .
4535	Argument_against	A lot of people are also scared that if reproductive cloning becomes a commonplace , people might be cloned unwillingly by unscrupulous individuals .
4536	NoArgument	This view has decisive moral force for those who believe it ( often those who also oppose abortion ) .
4537	Argument_against	There 's going to be people who turn something wonderful or helpful , into something destructive .
4538	NoArgument	Up until the recent years , the research method mainly focused on Embryonic Stem Cells , which involves taking tissue from an aborted embryo to get proper material to study .
4539	NoArgument	The best approach would be to bring this research under the oversight of the federal government by funding it through the National Institutes of Health .
4540	Argument_against	So having human cloning may make this world a criminal scene or something .
4541	NoArgument	Prepared by Opinion Research Corporation .
4542	NoArgument	In fact , nearly 98 % of efforts in cloning failed .
4543	Argument_against	( f ) Cloning would potentially pose a threat to human diversity and cause a reduction in genetic diversity .
4544	Argument_against	I know it may help cure diseases and all , but if we 've survived all these years without doing cloning , then it 's really not mandatory .
4545	NoArgument	We must tread carefully .
4546	Argument_for	In return , however , the advantages of cloning are also quite apparent : human cloning could very well lead to faster medical cures , a better overall quality of life , and even longer life spans .
4547	Argument_for	Moral arguments against cloning are unfair to future human clones How would you feel if you were a clone and society considered your creation illegal and your existence deplorable ?
4548	NoArgument	If the clone is considered fully human , then hopefully secular ethics would prevent murder .
4549	Argument_against	They feel that interfering with how nature work would have a domino effect on the human race .
4550	Argument_against	If the cloning process is not successful , there is a high chance that the DNA of the host could be altered or worse , damaged .
4551	Argument_for	Cloning could be used to avoid the uncertain genetic outcomes of sexual reproduction , and to give children the best , most healthful genes possible .
4552	Argument_against	Many people believe that because clones were created by man , they will be unable to feel and empathize .
4553	NoArgument	The government does n’t fund research , and the FDA regulates research on public cloning .
4554	Argument_against	We risk overpopulation of a planet that is struggling to fuel it 's inhabitants as we speak .
4555	NoArgument	However , no evidence about the biological properties of children created through technologies like cloning could speak to the way the act of manufacturing children using these technologies will shape the relationship between the generations .
4556	NoArgument	for religion has brought nothing of use to mankind but a belief in death .
4557	Argument_for	For instance , the parents of a young child might choose to clone that child and could raise the resulting second child as if it were a natural sibling of the first .
4558	Argument_against	Humans should not be turned into an experimental playground . "
4559	Argument_against	A small proportion of identical twins do indeed suffer from psychological problems related to feelings of a lack of individuality .
4560	NoArgument	What are Stem Cells ?
4561	NoArgument	Providing the target disk is big enough , numerous backups can be saved simultaneously .
4562	Argument_for	Unless the cloned child ’s life is made so horrible by her disabilities that it would have been better that she not been born at all , she was not harmed by being brought into existence via cloning , even if she is born with genetic defects as a result .
4563	Argument_against	However , human cloning is a completely artificial form of reproduction , which leaves no trace of the dignity of human procreation .
4564	Argument_against	Meanwhile , millions of animals languish in shelters awaiting adoption every year .
4565	NoArgument	The following reviews key questions and answers about the public 's view of this controversial issue .
4566	Argument_for	CAMR works to ensure that somatic cell nuclear transfer ( SCNT ) and therapeutic cloning remain a legal and viable form of scientific research and to protect and preserve continued federal funding of human embryonic stem cell research .
4567	NoArgument	The various differences we can see between identical twins provide clear evidence of the limits of genetic determinism .
4568	Argument_for	South Africa considered therapeutic cloning to be aimed at protecting human life and , as such , it was not inconsistent with the Declaration just adopted .
4569	NoArgument	but scince he made us special then i dont think the we should do any of it .
4570	Argument_against	One of the methods used in cloning , induced pluripotent stem cells , has severe limitations .
4571	Argument_for	The cloned livestock would be a source of food for many hungry countries .
4572	Argument_for	As cloning advocate Gregory E. Pence writes , cloning “ would be a naturally controlled experiment .... The genome of the ancestor is the control , and variations in genes , environment , or choice will show how things could have been different . ”
4573	Argument_against	The human body is so complicated that scientists have to be able to predict what sort of affects their actions will have , and they simply can not account for everything that could go wrong .
4574	Argument_for	That way , parents who want to choose their child ’s sex , eye color and other physical attributes , will be able to fulfill their plans .
4575	Argument_against	Research suggests that creating cloned embryos who can continue developing or who can provide functional stem cells may not be possible .
4576	NoArgument	Though both these terms use the word “ cloning , ” they are still not entirely accurate .

4585	NoArgument	A baby with a genome identical to that of an adult progenitor would be physiologically , psychologically , and socially much more similar to other babies than to his older “ identical twin . ”
4586	Argument_for	If someone is hurting over a death , they can reproduce the child .
4587	NoArgument	Dairy industry support continued FDA ban on selling cloned-cow milk ( 2005 , July 15 ) .
4588	Argument_for	Eugene Volokh , a professor at the UCLA School of Law , puts it this way : “ Scientists should generally have the freedom to experiment , people should generally have the freedom to have important life-saving technologies , and parents should generally have the freedom to make their children 's lives better , unless [ cloning is shown to ] cause serious , tangible harm . ”
4589	NoArgument	Home page By submitting this form , you accept the Mollom privacy policy .
4590	Argument_for	Moreover , every time that a doctor performs life-saving surgery or administers drugs he is changing the destiny of the patient and could be thus seen as usurping the role of God .
4591	NoArgument	I promise you that .
4592	NoArgument	Many of these objections could also be raised against stem-cell research .
4593	Argument_against	But while it is important that we prohibit cloning-to-produce-children to prevent the long-term degradation of the family , we can not do so without also making a strong case against the much more immediate threat posed by cloning-for-biomedical-research .
4594	Argument_against	Several scientists dismissed that argument , saying that it remains impossible to clone a baby .
4595	Argument_for	" From the mouse data , we know that [ embryonic cloning ] is better than iPS cells , " Cibelli said .

4597	Argument_for	John A. Robertson points to a number of circumstances under which parents might seek to clone one of their minor children , including the desire for a “ second child like the first ” or one “ who could be a source of tissue or organs ” or a second child “ to replace a dead or dying child with one with its genes . ”
4598	NoArgument	The president stopped short of allowing federal funding for research using stem cells derived from frozen embryos , about 100,000 of which exist at fertility labs across the country , many awaiting destruction .
4599	NoArgument	Like you said about the twins , they develop different personalities only because they live separate lives and have different experiences from one another .
4600	Argument_against	What if we start demanding ‘ designer babies ’ , children whose hair color , eye color , height and intelligence we ourselves dictate ?
4601	Argument_against	And the fact that IVF has proven safe proves neither that the original IVF experiments were ethical ( they were not ) nor that the success of the IVF experiments provides ethical justification for proceeding with human cloning experiments ( it does not ) .
4602	Argument_for	Cloning evil people will not result in evil clones " Why cloning people is a good idea " .
4603	Argument_for	Some have argued the opposing side , however , and have maintained that respect for procreative liberty not only entails access to artificial reproductive technology , but also the right to employ gamete donors and surrogate mothers ( Ethics Committee of the American Fertility Society , 1985 ) .
4604	Argument_for	One response typically given by philosophers when concerning the ethics of preconception decisions that may lead to the birth of a disabled child involves an appeal to Derek Parfit ’s nonidentity problem ( Parfit , 1984 , though Parfit himself does not apply this to cloning ) .
4605	Argument_against	The first IVF experiments could not be carried out ethically , he warned , since “ the unmade child has not ‘ volunteered ’ to help the scientist . ”

4609	NoArgument	A child created by cloning would be an exact replica of an existing or deseased person .
4610	Argument_against	Moreover , Ian Wilmut and other commentators have noted that we can not know whether clones will suffer from premature ageing as a result of their elderly genes .
4611	Argument_for	Some people will owe their lives to this technology , and some infertile couples will be grateful for having had the chance to raise a child of their own .
4612	Argument_for	And surely we would hold that these diseases and birth defects were bad for the children .
4613	Argument_against	But when made through technologically mediated processes , children can be seen by parents and doctors as products to be shaped and controlled , accepted or rejected .
4614	NoArgument	Sometimes the critics speak in terms of the autonomy of the child being violated , diminished or denied , although it can be very difficult to spell out exactly what this amounts to .
4615	Argument_for	A person suffering from cellular degeneration can have the problem resolved .
4616	Argument_for	And from the point of view of parents who want children who can checkmate like Kasparov , belt like Aretha , dunk like Dr. J , or bend it like Beckham , cloning could represent a way to have offspring with the exceptional abilities of these individuals .

4626	NoArgument	Biblically , there is a great distinction between animals and people .
4627	Argument_against	Such a lax standard denies us the most compelling and obvious reasons for condemning experiments that are clearly unethical .
4628	Argument_for	This is a question which appears to be entirely lost on Kass , since he completely ignores the question of presumption and jumps into giving a series of ultimately flawed reasons against human cloning .
4629	NoArgument	By putting yourself as your own greatest being ( in an non-conceited way ) you are able to control and handle your life the way you should , and you are responsible for all your actions .

4631	NoArgument	Whenever the issue has been discussed by policymakers , opposition has been largely bipartisan .
4632	Argument_for	Identical twins , as natural clones , do n’t seem to have identity problems , and if they did , a ban on them is not the answer .
4633	NoArgument	The new study though not aimed at human cloning , makes it more likely that someone else will try to clone a baby , Prentice said .
4634	Argument_for	These individual stem cells hold great promise for the treatment and cures of life threatening diseases and illnesses , such as cancer , Parkinson ’s , Alzheimer ’s , diabetes , ALS and spinal cord injury .

4643	NoArgument	The debate about human cloning is ongoing – how do you feel about the subject ?
4644	Argument_against	We should n't use clones to replace a dead family member , friend , or spouse because then there could be an out break and the clones could start pointless wars and arguments .
4645	Argument_against	That is defying the rules of god .
4646	Argument_against	She quotes some of the Council ’s discussion about how cloning could result in family relations that “ would differ from all existing family arrangements ” because of the “ unique , one-sided , and replicative biological connection to only one progenitor ” — but she then badly mischaracterizes that discussion : “ This is another way of saying that the technology is unnatural and leads to unnatural results . ”
4647	NoArgument	Occasionally , animals and humans are born as twins .

4661	NoArgument	Steel is only the latest .
4662	NoArgument	This theory can constantly be argued with , but at the end of the day , there will not be an answer until we clone a human and see how he/she reacts .
4663	Argument_against	Nevertheless , they do not connect this analysis to the issue of human dignity and both conclude that reproductive cloning still creates problems in relation to individual autonomy .
4664	Argument_against	The ethos that underlies these positions is , of course , both scientifically inaccurate and philosophically problematic .

4673	NoArgument	In 2011 Japanese scientists announced that they had plans to attempt to bring back a Woolly Mammoth .
4674	Argument_for	Our experience of identical twins shows that individuals with identical genomes are capable of forming their own life plans , their own senses of who they are , and all the rest of the complex psychological and social desiderata that constitute personal identity .
4675	Argument_for	When people are able to clone themselves they will be able to choose which type of person shall be born .
4676	Argument_against	By exercising this kind of control over the genetic ancestry and the genetic properties of children , cloning would undermine parents ’ openness toward what is novel in the next generation .
4677	Argument_for	Of course , it is possible that cloning could be used in conjunction with genetic modification , by allowing scientists to perform extensive genetic manipulations of somatic cells before transferring them to oocytes .
4678	NoArgument	Cloning has been banned in many countries but therapeutic cloning is very much prevalent .
4679	Argument_for	They see cloning as a route towards a Brave New World of human genetic engineering .

4687	NoArgument	The medical benefits that are possible through human cloning are not even fully known .
4688	Argument_against	It may reduce the overall value of human life .
4689	NoArgument	Each type is seen as a form of cloning , but they are classified differently .
4690	Argument_for	This can be done naturally ( i.e. , twins ) or using technology with plants and animals .
4691	Argument_for	Seeing the way that their bodies are structured and function would help us to better decipher the state of the earth before they became extinct .
4692	NoArgument	There was a dichotomy between reproductive and therapeutic cloning and , during the entire process , Mexico had focused on seeking a consensus , first on the negotiation of a mandate and subsequently on the text itself .

4694	NoArgument	The representative of the United States , welcoming the adoption of the Declaration , recalled that his delegation had explained its position in the Sixth Committee and would not give a further explanation today .
4695	Argument_for	So maybe actually cloning a human or possibly super humans might not be the best for the world today but great medical advantages can come if cloning is not banned and further research is allowed .
4696	NoArgument	But if we let this stop us , we will never move forward .
4697	NoArgument	Japan ’s representative said he had voted against the resolution .
4698	Argument_for	But for people seeking to give their child the best chance at having exceptional intelligence , cloning may at least seem to offer more control and predictability than gene modification , and cloning is more consistent with our limited understanding of the science of genetics .
4699	NoArgument	It is stimulated in the hope that the cell can then be reprogrammed and develop into an embryo , from which stem cells ( which can turn themselves into any sort of cell ) can be removed .
4700	Argument_for	The research would give great insights about the basics of the body .
4701	Argument_against	Similar issues could arise for cloned domesticated animals , particularly if they fully replaced animals that created genetic variation through normal breeding methods .

4706	NoArgument	The answer is stem cells .
4707	Argument_against	Most scientists argue against reproductive human cloning on the grounds that it is not safe .
4708	Argument_for	Additionally , if the reason people treat cloned children unfavorably is due to their misconceptions about cloning , then the proper response is not to ban cloning at the expense of compromising procreative liberty , but rather work to rectify these prejudices and misconceptions ( Burley and Harris , 1999 ) .
4709	NoArgument	Humans , with the help of a common language , were on the verge of building a tower all the way to Heaven .
4710	NoArgument	A bill to that effect has been proposed by the current House , but not the Senate , said David Prentice , senior fellow for life sciences at the Family Research Council .

4712	Argument_for	Who 's to say we do n't deserve the chance to have a clone of ourselves , imagine all the things they could help us with !
4713	Argument_for	This weakness may also , however , make cloning more appealing than other forms of genetic engineering , especially when we consider the genetic complexity of many desirable traits .
4714	Argument_for	However , this misconception may quickly be rectified simply by observing the unique personality of the cloned child , especially since her experiences and her nurture , removed by at least a generation , will be substantially different than that of her genetic predecessor ( Dawkins , 1998 ; Pence , 1998 ) .
4715	NoArgument	But cloning researchers have found that , in the absence of compensation , they are simply unable to find enough women willing to provide eggs for their research .

4720	NoArgument	If you cloned yourself the clone would not be like your sister , or brother , it would be an exact copy of you .
4721	NoArgument	But issues relating to cloning technology remain crucial to debates over biomedical research and its regulation .
4722	Argument_for	But if cloning is going to be used for a good purpose , then it can help improve humanity , as it can help cure incurable diseases .
4723	Argument_against	One huge reason will be that the child will be brought up in a highly abnormal household : one where grief has been diverted into makeing a clone instead of adjusting to loss .

4731	Argument_against	It is hard to say whether this is true , but we have seen devastating consequences of other research-programs , even with good intentions , such as nuclear research .
4732	NoArgument	The day human cloning happens will be glorious for some and the day that human cloning takes over will be end for much more .
4733	Argument_for	Surely it is preferable for a mother to know the genetic heritage of her offspring , rather than accept sperm from an unknown and random donor ?
4734	Argument_for	This would provide an ideal projectile for splitting the nucleus of the atom .
4735	Argument_for	The fact that stem cell therapy was made possible because of cloning techniques speaks volumes of the potential of the technology to cure a wide range of diseases .
4736	Argument_against	The cloning of a monkey or other non-human primate would likely be a " strong signal " that it 's time to set some rules around human cloning , Cibelli said .
4737	NoArgument	The process of human cloning is as sci-fi as the idea behind it .
4738	NoArgument	This means you get an immediate copy including the hard disk structure , i.e. the partition layout and split .
4739	Argument_for	Some science fiction writers have speculated that extinct members of the genus Homo , such as Neanderthals , could be revived through cloning .
4740	NoArgument	But you ca n't over due it .

4742	Argument_against	Human beings are not simply genes and molecules .
4743	NoArgument	The real action is with what is known as “ therapeutic cloning ” .
4744	Argument_for	Opposition to cloning is n't just Luddism -- it 's racism . "
4745	NoArgument	That a clone could be compared to its alter ego is not an argument against cloning .
4746	NoArgument	They are tiny in size and unfamiliar in appearance , but they are unmistakably individual human organisms — they do not become human at some later developmental stage .
4747	Argument_against	But one of the arguments that people have against artificial cloning is that people are trying to play God by creating life in unnatural ways .
4748	Argument_against	The philosopher Hilary Putnam offered a useful analysis of the role of strong moral reactions against cloning in a 1999 lecture , in which he argued that the strong and immediate moral condemnation of human cloning was justified , even though the grounds for this condemnation could not be “ easily derived from already-codified moral doctrines . ”
4749	Argument_against	Some people feel great reluctance to eat cloned meat , which might lower the value of animals that are cloned .
4750	NoArgument	But the arguments will go on .
4751	NoArgument	It is to that case we now turn .
4752	Argument_against	( Even so , suppose you were a slightly deformed human clone - would you agree that it was a terrible moral offense to have caused you to come into existence ? )
4753	NoArgument	Again , the issue of genetic diversity is an important one .
4754	NoArgument	[ 5 – 8 ] The goal of this paper is not to provide a comprehensive review of these possible definitions , and there are many , or to definitively answer the question of whether human reproductive cloning infringes human dignity .
4755	NoArgument	Men are more supportive of this type of cloning than are women , and younger Americans are more supportive than are older Americans -- six in 10 Americans below age 50 express support , while just 46 % of those age 50 and above do so .
4756	NoArgument	Can it still succeed at home ?
4757	NoArgument	There is no such thing as an artificial womb .

4766	NoArgument	England - The British government introduced legislation to allow therapeutic cloning in a debate on January 14 , 2001 .
4767	Argument_against	" A life is a life and that should never be compromised .
4768	NoArgument	Similarly , even something we typically associate as " good " - for example , giving - can be used for bad - over-giving , or smothering .
4769	Argument_against	However , what is to stop just a handful of people taking the research too far ?
4770	Argument_against	In vitro fertilisation remains an imperfect technology .
4771	NoArgument	God knows how our lives will turn out way before our moms knew they were pregnant .
4772	Argument_against	Transferring a cloned cow embryo into a cow uterus results in a healthy calf less than 10 percent of the time , Cibelli told LiveScience .
4773	Argument_against	There is no way of knowing how children will react to having such a confused genetic heritage .
4774	NoArgument	Reproductive cloning at least envisages allowing the embryos to live , whereas therapeutic cloning means creating embryos in order to destroy them and use their cells .
4775	Argument_for	As Professor Savulescu so neatly counters , ‘ to say that creating a clone is an affront to human dignity is like saying that deliberately creating a black person , or a woman , affronts human dignity .
4776	Argument_against	The success rate of genetic experiments leaves a lot to be desired , after all .
4777	NoArgument	It was one of the only websites that I used for my research paper for school .
4778	Argument_for	Would the same advocates of this objection against cloning object to artificial insulin injections to treat diabetes ?

4780	Argument_against	Philosophy professor Allen E. Buchanan , for instance , argues that ethicists like Kass “ insinuate that the only reasons most people have for producing a human by cloning are unseemly — for example , to act out a sick fantasy of recreating their dead child from the DNA in a strand of hair or to indulge in their narcissism . ”
4781	NoArgument	“ We just wanted people to realize that [ cloning ] was moving very rapidly from science to a commercial technology , ” Michael Bishop , vice president of research for De Forest biotechnology company , told a reporter for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel .
4782	NoArgument	In addition , it provides a model for studying the interaction of nuclear verses mitochondrial genes and for nuclear verses cytoplasmic factors .
4783	NoArgument	Polly , a transgenic cloned lamb , is an example .

4785	NoArgument	He has a plan for each of us .
4786	NoArgument	Thank you for helping to improve wiseGEEK !
4787	NoArgument	With or without a belief in God or gods , there will always be a yearning for immortality in humankind as a race .
4788	Argument_for	If it helps more than it harms , can it really be that bad ?
4789	NoArgument	Is human cloning means playing God ?
4790	Argument_against	The most basic of all is that it involves killing a potential human being .
4791	NoArgument	This argument takes three general forms .
4792	Argument_against	Humans are not set for the role of controlling nature and genetics in a godly like position .
4793	Argument_for	One of these is the fact that we may be able to bring back animals that have been long extinct !
4794	NoArgument	We should not clone animals or humans , cloning should be used to help replicate organs and cells to ensure that we , as humans , can live better lives .
4795	Argument_against	You can not have so-called therapeutic cloning without reproductive cloning because the technique to make cloned babies is the same as to make a cloned embryo to try to make replacement tissues .
4796	Argument_against	i think that the human race has so many issues with our teens and children today , that we need to work with what we have now , not neglect it , and be trying to create a " better " human .
4797	NoArgument	As Dr. Henry K. Beecher wrote in his seminal 1966 article on the ethics of clinical research , “ an experiment is ethical or not in its inception ; it does not become ethical post hoc — ends do not justify means . ”
4798	Argument_for	Treatment for Human Disease : Cells could be harvested from early embryos to provide cell and tissue replacement without the hazards of transplantation rejection .
4799	Argument_for	Women dispose of fertilized eggs during their menstrual cycle more often than they are aware ; one study claims that as many as 73 % of fertilized eggs do not survive to 6 weeks gestation ( Boklage , 1990 ) .
4800	NoArgument	Both an abortion and someone dying , suffering from a possible curable disease , is a tragedy .
4801	NoArgument	It is also possible that it will be brought up differently .
4802	NoArgument	The clone may also have a surrogate mother .
4803	Argument_against	A coalition of states , including Spain , Italy , Philippines , USA , Costa Rica and the " Holy Land " have tried to expand the debate on all forms of human cloning , noting that in their view , therapeutic cloning violates human dignity .
4804	NoArgument	Talent , education and wisdom only have potential .
4805	NoArgument	Also this morning , the Assembly conveyed its deepest condolences to the families of the nine United Nations peacekeepers from Bangladesh who were killed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Friday , 25 February .

4807	NoArgument	he wants us to follow him .
4808	NoArgument	( 1 ) The third type of cloning called replacement cloning is a possibility in theory and would be a combination of therapeutic cloning and reproductive cloning .
4809	NoArgument	January 1 , 2003 - " Whenever a new possibility comes along we tend to oppose it .
4810	Argument_for	If we are able to create clones , then god must have meant for it to be possible .
4811	NoArgument	Many fear that this could only result in further problems among the population .
4812	Argument_against	In our full report , we show what is at stake in the debate over cloning-for-biomedical-research , and why it is important to reject human cloning whatever its purpose is .
4813	Argument_against	The representatives of the Netherlands said his country had opposed the Declaration because it could be interpreted as a total ban on all forms of cloning .
4814	Argument_against	The “ genetic parents ” of a cloned child in this sense could be dead decades before their child is conceived , and the biological connection between them and their new genetic child will be completely mediated by another individual , namely , their child , the person whose genome has been replicated .
4815	NoArgument	There is also a religious dimension to patterns of support for cloning , with non-religious Americans being far more supportive of animal cloning than are those who are more religious .
4816	NoArgument	It was in January 2001 , when word about human cloning surfaced .
4817	NoArgument	Whether or not popular opinion is the best stand for this controversy is addressed by attempting to answer the above questions and to conclude whether or not human reproductive cloning should be effectively banned .
4818	NoArgument	Unknown Illnesses Over time , viruses and bacteria develop and change , this is true for thousands of years ago as well .
4819	NoArgument	it really helped when i did my cloning report .
4820	Argument_for	Even more than other reproductive technologies , cloning would involve children being made by doctors and technicians in accordance with the designs and wishes of parents .
4821	Argument_for	For example , while there is no evidence that Dolly ’s respiratory issues were due to her being a clone , questions remain whether her arthritis , which is uncommon among sheep her age , could have resulted because of the nature of her genesis ( Williams , 2003 ) .
4822	Argument_for	Giving all people the ability to have their own children is a huge benefit that human cloning can eventually provide down the line .
4823	Argument_against	The poll also found that 22 % believe that cloning interferes with distinctiveness and individuality , while the same percentage said cloning could be used for questionable purposes .

4829	Argument_against	But advocacy groups on opposite ends of the political spectrum said Friday that the study is a reminder of the need for government to step in before someone tries to extend this technique to engineer a human clone .
4830	NoArgument	In fact , she does not even own any of the clones .
4831	Argument_against	However , scenarios like this one ( and others involving simple genetic diseases ) seem implausible , because there are other existing technologies that doctors can recommend to achieve the same end — including sperm or egg donation and preimplantation genetic diagnosis ( PGD ) .
4832	NoArgument	To date , private funding has been the sole financing mechanism for important stem cell research .
4833	Argument_against	In the realm of genetics , it is far better to be safe than sorry .
4834	NoArgument	Evidently , there is no biblical statement on the ethics of human cloning .
4835	Argument_for	Moreover , defective genes could be eliminated with cloning a human ’s body ’s good cells .
4836	Argument_against	And therapeutic cloning is never therapeutic for the cloned embryo , which is destroyed , and is not necessarily therapeutic for any particular patients .
4837	NoArgument	Human cloning is one area of genetic engineering that has ignited intense debates .
4838	Argument_against	Cloning undermines the natural relationship between procreation and family Pamela Schaeffer .

4841	Argument_against	When that happens , it could create a whole new set of issues that we may not have any knowledge on .
4842	Argument_for	It 's true that iPS cells have great promise .
4843	Argument_against	To ensure that a technique for creating life is safe enough to be ethically justifiable would paradoxically require experiments made under conditions where that knowledge is not available , and such experiments would themselves be unjustifiable : as Ramsey writes , “ we can not morally get to know how to perfect this technique . ”
4844	NoArgument	Hungary was open for further discussions in the international community at the appropriate time .
4845	Argument_for	Others have the potential to repair or replace damaged tissue or cells .
4846	Argument_against	You will not find a child psychiatrist in the world who could possibly say that there will not be very significant emotional risk to the cloned child as a result of these pressures .
4847	Argument_against	And cloning-for-biomedical-research will lay the technical and practical groundwork for cloning-to-produce-children and a number of other morally troubling acts .
4848	Argument_for	The clone is not an exact copy , in spite of sharing DNA with the person from whom he/she was cloned .
4849	NoArgument	Identical twins should be prohibited if this dignity argument has any merit , but there have been no moves in modern times to prohibit twins .
4850	Argument_for	Maintaining Biodiversity : Cloning may be an important tool for preserving endangered species if currently practiced methods fail .
4851	Argument_for	it would be good , to a certain extent .
4852	NoArgument	Any work of the sort would need Food and Drug Administration approval in the United States — not a given , by any means — but rogue clinics or scientists in less-regulated nations could make attempts , he said .
4853	Argument_for	However , there seems to be a way out of the ethical dilemma posed by cloning-for-biomedical research : the human induced pluripotent stem ( iPS ) cells first developed in 2007 provide a promising alternative that does not rely on the destruction of embryos .
4854	Argument_for	There have been times when majorities have been wrong about what is morally repugnant : xenophobia and racism are often accompanied by a moralistic sense of repugnance , yet we rightly reject them both .
4855	NoArgument	Thanks to biotechnology , what it means to “ have a child ” is increasingly becoming radically open : legal contracts allow prospective parents to choose which individuals with which biological relationships will be considered the child ’s parents ( whether a particular woman is a “ surrogate ” or the recipient of a “ donor embryo ” is a matter of choice , not biology ) .
4856	NoArgument	Human cloning is not something that is easily understood or explained .
4857	Argument_against	What we are left with , then , is the desire to have a child without a “ partner , ” even an anonymous sperm donor .
4858	Argument_for	More generally , people come to embrace new technologies , even those that initially seemed shocking and “ unnatural ” , once concrete benefits become clear .
4859	NoArgument	" My feeling is that it 's sort of an unintentional step in that direction , " said Paul Knoepfler , a stem cell researcher at the University of California Davis School of Medicine .
4860	Argument_for	Second , cloning could allow prospective parents to protect their children from a broad array of diseases known to be associated with genetic risk factors .
4861	Argument_for	Diseases which have dogged us for generations could be wiped out due to our evolving faster than they could ever hope to . "
4862	Argument_against	It may work wonders but who knows if playing with the nature is “ really safe ” ?
4863	NoArgument	so i think it is wrong to do stuff like that .
4864	NoArgument	The text , noted Costa Rica ’s representative , sought to advance science in a clear framework of ethical norms .
4865	Argument_against	How can they possibly understand the ramifications of slight changes made at the smallest level ?
4866	NoArgument	Clearly , if children are produced through cloning , they should be treated in accordance with the human rights and human dignity they share with all other human beings .
4867	Argument_for	A child who is created as a “ savior sibling ” may still , also , be loved and respected as an individual in her own right , and therefore may not necessarily be treated solely as a means ( Boyle and Savulescu , 2001 ) .
4868	NoArgument	When we talk about what we mean human cloning ?
4869	Argument_against	One common claim is that bringing children into the world in this way is somehow a violation of the natural order , or of human dignity ; or perhaps it would be an act of “ playing God ” .
4870	NoArgument	We may have facts to support them , but we will never fully understand anything .
4871	Argument_against	Also , is n't the U.S known for our diversity and our originality in how not one person is the same ?
4872	NoArgument	Instead of just worrying about the problem , I decided to do whatever I could do to help others .
4873	NoArgument	Religion is a passifier to hale the human race and give it meaning , and a reason to work together .
4874	NoArgument	One thing can be sure though , that when animals like the wooly mammoth walked the earth , the environment was in much better shape .
4875	Argument_for	Worship your God all you please , but Cloning is the Future and it WILL happen one way or the other .
4876	NoArgument	A sexual relationship would of course be with his wife 's twin , no incest involved technically .
4877	NoArgument	For person 12 and his comment ; here is a response .
4878	NoArgument	Human reproductive cloning is the term used to describe the process that takes place when a human clone is created .
4879	NoArgument	We sequenced a Mad cDNA and identified three Mad point mutations that alter the coding information .
4880	NoArgument	Pressure might sometimes be placed on the sexual offspring of two people , who might be successful scientists , artists , sportspeople , actors , politicians , etc .
4881	Argument_against	Besides , many experts believe that there is no clone that is fully healthy .
4882	Argument_for	Allows infertile couples to have children .
4883	Argument_against	Cloned animals that survive long enough to be born often suffer from health problems .
4884	Argument_for	RESOLVE further believes that infertility patients should be free from interference in making the very personal decision about the uses of their own body tissues , including reproductive tissues and fertilized reproductive tissues .
4885	Argument_against	Those in favour of the Declaration welcomed its adoption , saying it constituted an important step in the protection of human dignity and the promotion of human rights , as well as a stepping stone in the process towards a complete ban on human cloning .
4886	NoArgument	Determining if this process is safe or ethical is normally up to personal opinion , but having more information at your disposal never hurts .
4887	Argument_for	As to the legal ramifications ; there is no law on the books concerning legal rights of a cloned individual .
4888	Argument_for	Infertile Couple Can Have Children Human cloning has the ability to make it possible for couples that were once not able to have their own children to finally have babies without having to use sperm donation or surrogacy .
4889	Argument_against	This would be like a scene from an old movie entitled Gattaca , where parents can choose specific traits , such as eye color and sex , for their future child .

18306	Argument_against	Even with only 0.1 % loss and a 10 day cycle something like 2/3 of the thorium would end up in the wast .
18307	NoArgument	If the anti-nuclear crowd has even 10 % of the public afraid of nuclear power in any form , then a politician who supports nuclear power will lose the votes of that 10 % which could easily change the outcome of an election .
18308	Argument_against	Despite ongoing quarrels over its costs and an international perception that “ German angst ” caused the government to shut down reactors after the Fukushima accident , a vast majority of Germans is still in favour of putting an end to nuclear power .
18309	NoArgument	Secondly are the actions such as rallies and blockades which usually involve more participation from the community .
18310	NoArgument	Thus too scientists are encouraged to remain detached from the social consequences of their work .
18311	NoArgument	As your first statement is the assumption upon which the remainder of your argument rests , quite simply the argument makes no sense at all .
