808	Argument_against	Research cloning is likely to be too costly to be used in the course of routine medical procedures .
809	Argument_for	Cloning has the potential to change the world for infertile couples almost overnight .
810	Argument_for	In a free society , people have the right to pursue any scientific-and especially medical-investigation .
811	Argument_against	That is , in order for advocates of this objection to be consistent , they should be equally willing to ban other forms of reproductive technology that may result in harm to potential offspring .
812	NoArgument	Some of the arguments are religious in nature .
813	NoArgument	Recently , the controversy around human cloning has received a lot of news coverage ; yet unsurprisingly , a clear and thorough examination of both sides has been lacking from the news media .
814	Argument_for	also two gay women could use this technology to conceive a child of their own using their individual 23 chromosomes . "
815	Argument_against	In a sense , this objection maintains that a cloned child would either lack the free will to live her life according to her own desire and goals or that , at the very least , her free will would be severely restricted by her parents or the society that has certain expectations of her given her genetic lineage .
816	Argument_for	For example cloning can be used to get more hair from a few sample hair follicles or grafts from the patient 's head and then grow them .... later transplant the grafts where it is needed .
817	NoArgument	Randall Curren ( ed . )
818	NoArgument	Human society can accept or reject any proposed technology on its own merits .
819	Argument_against	Also , it could create new societal division , where perfect clones would be treated in a different way than those who are naturally born .
820	Argument_for	The process of transplanting human organs can become simpler , with an immensely improved success rate .
821	Argument_against	Ian Wilmut , Dolly ’s creator , has denounced human reproductive cloning as too dangerous to attempt ( Travis , 2001 ) .
822	NoArgument	Furthermore , there is an immense difference between a woman 's desire to terminate an unwanted pregnancy and the desire to create a genetic duplicate of another person .
823	NoArgument	Illmensee , Karl et al. ( 2009 ) , “ Human Embryo Twinning with Applications in Reproductive Medicine . ”
824	Argument_against	The child ’s very desire to be different from her predecessor illustrates that she is not destined to be like her predecessor .
825	NoArgument	While the debate about cloning humans is ongoing , how do you feel about it ?
826	Argument_against	In addition , anything that thwarts the natural process of conception ( i.e. , birth control ) may also be morally condemned .
827	Argument_against	People who have strong religious beliefs generally oppose the process of cloning humans , as they feel that it would result in man becoming the creator , changing the authority of a supreme being .
828	NoArgument	In return , however , its advantages are also quite apparent .
829	NoArgument	Many other media outlets , although usually shying away from the ominous representation of clones so prevalent in the movies , have usually portrayed clones as , essentially , facsimiles of their genetic predecessor .
830	Argument_for	For example , the February 19 , 2001 cover shows two mirror image infants staring at each other , the tagline suggesting that cloning may be used by grieving parents who wish to resurrect their dead child .
831	NoArgument	She would also likely be raised in a much different society ( e.g. , a child born in 2010 would have vastly different social influences than a child born in the 1960s or 1970s ) .
832	Argument_against	They said that this form of interference is decidedly wrong and can lead to a domino effect , which means that other attributes of life could be changed or altered negatively as a result .
833	NoArgument	They think that it would be completely wrong to bring children into the world knowing that they can be affected by these problems .
834	Argument_against	Because cloning involves the artificial process of recreating a pre-existing genetic code , prospective parents could , first , choose their child ’s DNA ( thereby creating a “ designer child ” ) , and , second , because they are creating a “ replica ” of an existing person , they will consider the child more akin to property than an individual in her own right .
835	Argument_against	Many believe that cloning is against God ’s wishes because the clones would be created by man .
836	Argument_against	It risks the possibility of faster aging .
837	NoArgument	Create an A + Biology research paper with an online class .
838	Argument_for	One argument in favor of artificial embryo twinning is that it provides an infertile couple , who may not have been able to produce many viable embryos through IVF , with more embryos that they can then implant for an increased chance at successful reproduction ( Robertson , 1994 ) .
839	NoArgument	The room was quiet as Boisselier read the man 's words : “ I decided then and there that I would never give up on my child .
840	NoArgument	“ Double-Blind Controlled Trial of Human Embryonic Dopamine Cell Transplants in Advanced Parkinson ’s Disease : Study , Design , Surgical Strategy , Patient Demographics , and Pathological Outcome ” ( presented to the American Academy of Neurology ) .
841	NoArgument	Since Dolly , many more mammals have been cloned through the use of SCNT .
842	NoArgument	For people who became quadriplegic due to horrific traffic accidents and professional athletes who tore their ACLs , recovery time could be long or it is even impossible for them to get back to their original state .
843	NoArgument	Brigitte Boisselier , a chemist working with couples who want to use cloning techniques to create babies , read aloud a letter from “ a father ( Dada ) . ”
844	NoArgument	Access to affordable healthcare is a general social issue , not specific to research cloning .
845	NoArgument	There is no inconsistency between supporting the former and opposing the latter .
846	Argument_against	Even if a clone were to appear healthy at birth , there are concerns about health problems arising later in life .
847	NoArgument	The concept of a “ savior sibling , ” a child that is deliberately conceived so that she could provide a means ( through the donation of bodily fluids , umbilical cord blood , a non-vital organ , or tissue ) to save an older sibling from illness or death is not new .
848	NoArgument	In a free society , people have the right to work together democratically to adopt policies that they believe contribute to building a better world .
849	Argument_for	Learning the process of reprogramming , differentiation , and dedifferentiation is likely to result in just as many medical miracles as stem cell research .
850	Argument_for	Cellular models of diseases can be developed as well , along with the ability to test drug efficacy : “ cloning a single skin cell from a patient with a disease could be used to produce inexhaustible amounts of cells and tissue with that disease .
851	NoArgument	The generational and historical differences between a clone and her genetic predecessor would undoubtedly go a long way when it comes to shaping the personality of the former ( Pence , 1998 ; Dawkins , 1998 ; Harris , 1997 ; Bor , 1997 ) .
852	Argument_for	Read about a girl who needs a kidney , a burn victim , a girl born with cosmetic deformities , a man who needs a liver , a woman who is infertile because of cancer , and a father who lost his only son .
853	NoArgument	Arguments offered for and against reproductive cloning are given below .
854	NoArgument	French , Andrew J. et al. ( 2008 ) , “ Development of Human Cloned Blastocysts Following Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer with Adult Fibroblasts . ”
855	Argument_against	Cloning children could foster an understanding that children can be designed and replicated to the parents ’ wishes .
856	Argument_for	Proposed therapeutic uses of cloning techniques would entail many millions of women 's eggs a year , a quantity that seems prohibitively large .
857	NoArgument	Only if I have harmed someone can my action be deemed morally wrong .
858	Argument_against	Because We Can : Just because science gives humanity the ability to do something does not mean that humankind should .
859	Argument_for	The current options for infertile couples are painful , expensive , and heart-breaking .
860	Argument_against	Next , imagine how easily for this race to fall into slavery .
861	Argument_against	Clones could be seen as less than human compared with non-clones .
862	NoArgument	Lumelsky , Nadya et al. ( 2001 ) , “ Differentiation of Embryonic Stem Cells to Insulin - Secreting Structures Similar to Pancreatic Islets , ” Science , 292 : 1389 – 1394 .
863	Argument_for	One of the most predominate themes underlying arguments for reproductive cloning is an appeal to procreative liberty .
864	Argument_against	The creation of cloned embryos would always be very labor intensive and expensive .
865	Argument_against	Creating a child for the sole purpose of saving another child violates the formula of humanity because the child is created specifically for this end .
866	NoArgument	Genetically speaking , a cloned child would be her genetic predecessor ’s identical twin sibling .
867	NoArgument	Human cloning is of special interest .
868	NoArgument	In a free society we know that we must tolerate some views that we do n't agree with so that we all may be free .
869	NoArgument	Once the embryo is approximately five days old , the stem cells are removed , cultured , differentiated to the desired type of body cell , and inserted back into the patient ( the genetic donor in this case ) .
870	Argument_against	There would be a lack of uniqueness and violate convictions regarding human individuality and freedom .
871	NoArgument	This was the position presented by Senator Arlen Specter in his proposed Senate Bill 2439 , called the “ Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2002 : A Bill to Prohibit Human [ Reproductive ] Cloning While Preserving Important Areas of Medical Research , Including Stem Cell Research . ”
872	Argument_against	In his article “ Even If It Worked , Cloning Wo n’t Bring Her Back ” , ethicist Thomas Murray recounts a letter he heard read at a congressional hearing regarding human reproductive cloning .
873	Argument_for	As most supporters of research cloning acknowledge , embryos created in IVF clinics can provide adequate numbers and varieties of stem cells for research purposes .
874	NoArgument	Response 2 : Knowing God ’s will .
875	Argument_against	Further , this argument appropriates the phrase " genetically related " to embrace a condition that has never before occurred in human history , one which abolishes the genetic variations that have always existed between parent and child .
876	NoArgument	In 1995 , Dr. Ian Wilmut and Dr. Keith Campbell successfully cloned two mountain sheep , Megan and Morag , from embryonic sheep cells .
877	Argument_for	It is an innovation that can change the world in a positive way .
878	NoArgument	Throughout history , parents who have lost children have grieved and sought consolation from family and community .
879	NoArgument	I believe that this reason is caused by fear from ignorance and religion and therefore logically baseless .
880	Argument_for	I find this reasoning absolutely ridiculous , since a person is a person despite their genetic source or if artificially created .
881	Argument_for	Second , extra embryos can be frozen , so they can avoid being killed too .
882	NoArgument	How Do You Feel About Human Cloning ?
883	Argument_for	Some twins describe their twin relationship as more wonderful and meaningful any other relationship in their lives .
884	NoArgument	So , would it help society at large or is it ethically questionable ?
885	NoArgument	There are two responses to this response .
886	Argument_for	Reproductive cloning would allow lesbians to have a child without having to use donor sperm , and gay men to have a child that does not have genes derived from an egg donor ( though , of course , a surrogate would have to carry the pregnancy ) .
887	NoArgument	Li , Ziyi ( 2006 ) , “ Cloned Ferrets Produced by Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer . ”
888	Argument_for	Medical technology has already improved our lives immensely , and we must support continued progress .
889	Argument_against	Given the evidence that genetic determinism is false , Murray further stresses that using cloning as a method of replacing a dead child “ is unfair .
890	NoArgument	Since identical twins are genetically the same yet very different people , it is unwise to expect cloned people to behave or have the same intelligence as the original genetic person .
891	NoArgument	In 2008 , a California research team succeeded in creating embryos via SCNT and growing them to the blastocyst stage ( French et al. , 2008 ) .
892	NoArgument	He confuses the deep end and shallow end and dives head first into the pool , breaking his neck and becoming a quadriplegic .
893	NoArgument	Most parents learn to communicate their expectations about their children in a moderate and ultimately positive way .
894	Argument_for	Japan has banned human cloning and will probably suffer by falling behind during the biotech revolution .
895	Argument_against	Children created by cloning would live in the shadow of the genetic donor , always having to live up to the expectations of a person they were created from .
896	Argument_for	It could eliminate infertility .
897	Argument_for	Reproductive cloning can provide genetically related children for people who can not be helped by other fertility treatments ( i.e. , who do not produce eggs or sperm ) .
898	NoArgument	Bor , Jonathan , “ Cloning Adds a Dimension to Nature-Nurture Debate : Identical Humans are Not in the Cards . ”
899	NoArgument	Some examples are deer , ferrets ( Li et al. , 2006 ) , mules ( Lovgren , 2003 ) , other sheep , goats , cows , mice , pigs , rabbits , a gaur , dogs , and cats .
900	NoArgument	She would be born into either the same family , but with a different dynamic , as her genetic predecessor , or be born into a different family altogether .
901	NoArgument	Though they might look alike , twins have different personalities and enjoy different things .
902	NoArgument	You would have a head start on the needs and talents of your child .
903	Argument_against	This could lead to a rise in malpractices within society .
904	NoArgument	The embryo is then induced to divide into genetic copies of itself , thereby artificially mimicking what happens when monozygotic multiples are formed ( Illmensee et al. , 2009 ) .
905	Argument_against	When thinking about cloning children designed and replicated to the parents ’ wishes , consider the book My Sister ’s Keeper in which Anna is the product of preimplantation genetic diagnosis and is born for the sole purpose of being a bone marrow plant for her older sister Kate .
906	NoArgument	What laws would there be to defend your rights as the true non-clone compared to the clone ?
907	Argument_against	Some forms of human experimentation are already forbidden , as is the sale of organs for transplant .
908	Argument_for	Interestingly , human cloning allows you the opportunity to participate in choosing the parents for your clone .
909	NoArgument	Not only is she lanky and thin , she has a grey coat over a white body and is lacking the patches of orange or tan typical to calicos .
910	NoArgument	He leaves five million to spinal cord research .
911	NoArgument	On the several occasions which Time Magazine has addressed the issue of cloning , the cover illustrates duplicate instances of the same picture .
912	Argument_for	Because of their plasticity , embryonic stem cells can be manipulated to become any cell in the human body , e.g. , neural cells , retinal cells , liver cells , pancreatic cells , or heart cells .
913	Argument_against	One big drawback to cloning humans is its ability to divide people , where clones who are not treated as human beings can lead to social unrest and divide .
914	NoArgument	The same can be said about cloning ( Pence , 1998 and 2008 ; Wachbroit , 1997 ) .
915	Argument_against	Concerns over individuality have also been raised ; whereas naturally occurring twins are valued as individuals , one worry is that embryos created through artificial twinning , precisely because of the synthetic nature of their genesis , may not be as valued ( McCormick , 1994 ) .
916	NoArgument	And it is this claim that we reject ... ” ( 2006 , 9 ) .
917	Argument_for	Furthermore , they seemed happy and willing to take away the hope of infertile couples and others with severe diseases that human cloning technology might one day lessen their suffering or save their lives .
918	NoArgument	Response 1 : Clarifying the meaning of “ playing God . ”
919	Argument_against	While it is admirable that the parents wish to save their existing child , it is not ethically permissible to create another child solely as an instrument to save the life of her sibling ( Quintavalle , 2001 ) .
920	NoArgument	An important philosophical issue is whether such a response against human cloning is warranted .
921	Argument_against	Because cloning entails recreating an existing person ’s genetic code ( with the exception of the difference in mitochondrial DNA ) , some argue that cloning would , necessarily , entail a violation of the cloned child ’s right to a distinctive genetic identity ( European Parliament , 1998 ) .
922	NoArgument	There are personality differences between Rainbow and CC as well ; whereas Rainbow is described as a shy , reticent , and a more “ hands-off ” kind of cat , CC is described as more playful , inquisitive , and affectionate ( Hays , 2003 ) .
923	Argument_for	However , cloning their own cells can lower recovery time and true healing could occur .
924	NoArgument	Because of the special relationship that twins have - Twins often have very special relationships .
925	Argument_for	This means infertile couples can experience happiness of having their own families without enduring painful procedures to treat infertility that are common today .
926	Argument_for	I donï ¿ ½ t think God in any religion has directly banned human cloning .
927	Argument_against	If reproductive cloning is permitted to happen and becomes accepted , it is difficult to see how any other dangerous applications of genetic engineering technology could be proscribed .
928	NoArgument	In 2004 , a Texas woman paid $ 50,000 to clone her deceased Maine Coone Nicky and , as a result , Little Nicky , the world ’s first commercially cloned cat , was born .
929	NoArgument	He dies feeling that although he was robbed of normal life , his twin/clone will lead a better life .
930	Argument_for	There is no reason that individuals and society ca n't learn to embrace human clones as just one more element of human diversity and creativity .
931	NoArgument	This involved enucleating a single-celled salamander embryo and inserting it with the nucleus of a differentiated salamander embryonic cell .
932	NoArgument	One year later , in 1996 , Wilmut and Campbell successfully cloned the first mammal to be born from an adult somatic cell , specifically an udder cell ( a sheep ’s mammary gland ) : Dolly the sheep ( Wilmut et al. , 1997 ) .
933	Argument_for	It can cure some disorders .
934	Argument_for	We are not saying that a clone would be a carbon copy with no individuality .
935	NoArgument	Furthermore , they were able to create a viable pregnancy and produce from it a healthy lamb ( however , there were 276 failed attempts before Dolly was created , which , as it will be discussed below , creates concerns over the safety and efficacy of the procedure ) .
936	Argument_for	Human cloning has already become illegal or restricted in a variety of degrees in several countries , thus scientific research has been greatly reduced throughout the world .
937	NoArgument	I would never stop until I could give his DNA - his genetic make-up - a chance ” ( 2001 ) .
938	NoArgument	Weinberg , Rivka ( 2008 ) , “ Identifying and Dissolving the Non-Identity Problem . ”
939	Argument_for	One use of this technology , for example , is to help treat individuals in the aftermath of a heart attack .
940	Argument_against	Egg retrieval is a complicated procedure , involving courses of hormone treatments and significant risks for the woman .
941	Argument_against	Because of these and other concerns , the United Nations and many countries have banned human cloning .
942	Argument_against	Many opponents of the technology feel that its process is artificial and interferes with nature , even believing that the natural process of procreation is not something that should be corrected or altered in a way .
943	Argument_for	This may mean making our children live longer , helping them to be resistant to cancer , heart disease , any familial diseases , and all the other problems that can be cured using what we learn from human cloning technology .
944	NoArgument	This was the first time the process had been accomplished for mammalian reproduction .
945	Argument_for	Even when depicting nonhuman cloning , films ( such as Jurassic Park ) tend to portray products of cloning as menacing , modern-day Frankensteinian monsters of sorts , which serve to teach humans a lesson about the dangers of “ playing God . ”
946	Argument_for	For many people , this is a huge advantage and a great way to use science in a new light .
947	Argument_for	If clonal embryos free of reprogramming errors can be created , establishing pregnancies is likely to be a trivial procedure .
948	Argument_for	Raising a clone would be like having a child with an instruction manual .
949	NoArgument	Wakayama , Teruhiko et al. ( 1999 ) , “ Mice Cloned from Embryonic Stem Cells . ”
950	Argument_against	And since there is already a great deal of gap and difference in the world today , from race to social status , many people feel that human cloning can result to a new difference that will only cause more harm .
951	Argument_against	The resulting child , moreover , would most likely be identified as the victim of my actions .
952	NoArgument	At a certain point in time , it was considered as a profound achievement in biology , but this is no longer the case these days , as the number of its opponents are increasing , making such technology quickly becoming a heated topic in debates from all over the world .
953	NoArgument	The research that led to her creation was funded by the California based company “ Genetic Savings and Clone , ” who , between 2004 and 2006 , offered grieving pet owners a chance to clone their sick or deceased pets ( they closed their doors in 2006 due to the unsustainability of their business ) .
954	Argument_against	Adopting an orphan is much easier , cheaper , virtuous , and safer solution than trying to clone a human being , not including helping a child in need .
955	Argument_for	We can not allow delays in the development of techniques that could save lives or prevent suffering .
956	Argument_against	Imagine discovering that you are the clone of a child your parents lost , and you live your life always being compared to the dead child .
957	NoArgument	A child produced by cloning would be the genetic duplicate of an existing person .
958	Argument_for	Because the sick will demand it - Those resisting human cloning research will probably find themselves shouted down by the sick and the maimed who desperately need such research .
959	NoArgument	At age 20 he comes down with herpes zoster of the trigeminal nerve .
960	Argument_for	The existence of a cloned person , therefore , could be mutually beneficial , rather than asymmetrical ) .
961	Argument_for	It is likely that the anti-cloners are quite wrong .
962	Argument_for	It can also bring about the recreation of species that have long since died , allowing scientists to fully study the species as a living creature instead of simply looking at images or bones .
963	NoArgument	Take an online course in GCSE Biology .
964	NoArgument	In 1902 , Hans Spemann cloned a salamander embryo through inducing twinning as well , using a hair from his infant son as a noose to divide the embryo .
965	Argument_for	Those countries that jump in first will reap the rewards .
966	Argument_for	Biotechnology will lead the next economic revolution .
967	NoArgument	This is the deeper and more far-reaching motivation behind much of the advocacy of human cloning .
968	NoArgument	In 1962 , John Gurdon announced that he too had successfully cloned frogs but , unlike Briggs and Kling ’s method , he did so by transferring differentiated intestinal nuclei from feeding tadpoles ( Wilmut et al. , 2000 ) .
969	NoArgument	As an example : Japan failed to jump on the Internet bandwagon and is now playing catch-up .
970	NoArgument	Boyle , Robert and Julian Savulescu ( 2001 ) “ Ethics of Using Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis to Select a Stem Cell Donor for an Existing Person . ”
971	NoArgument	From the ones that do implant , approximately 2 % to 3 % of newborn infants suffer from congenital abnormities of varying degrees of severity ( Kumar et al. , 2004 ) .
972	Argument_against	Because they would essentially be facsimiles of the original person , there is concern that the clones might possess less moral worth .
973	NoArgument	Gay couples - From one of our readers : " gay couples go through so much ... not to mention all the controversy ... when they decide that they are ready for a baby .
974	Argument_against	Rights are socially negotiated , and no " right " to clone oneself has ever been established .
975	Argument_for	Considering that identical twins are natural clones , we can regard reproductive cloning as the technological version of the process .
976	NoArgument	Yet almost immediately afterwards , the same narrator calls a clone “ You , version 2.0 . ”
977	Argument_against	It is speculated that human cloning could eventually be used as a means to exploit people for other people ’s vested interests .
978	Argument_against	These factors will contribute to viewing and treating the child as a mere commodity .
979	NoArgument	This supports Kass ’ claim that many people may expect a cloned child to be like her genetic predecessor .
980	Argument_against	Do humans have a soul , which would be lost during the process ?
981	Argument_against	Is this a way for humanity to try to replace God ?
982	Argument_against	If Callahan ’s concerns were accurate , identical multiples would fail to be individuals in their own right , and , consequently , be harmed because of this .
983	Argument_for	It is considered as the logical next step in reproductive technology .
984	NoArgument	The studies conducted by Golombok certainly seem to provide evidence to the contrary .
985	Argument_against	But this is too vague ; humans constantly interfere with nature in ways that are not morally criticized .
986	NoArgument	However , this research is still in its infancy and requires a lot more time , effort , and money before it matures into saving a lot more people .
987	Argument_against	Some studies suggest that research cloning may not be a necessary or desirable way to overcome immune rejection .
988	NoArgument	Because embryonic cells are undifferentiated , and therefore extremely malleable , it was not too surprising that transferred embryonic nuclei produced distinct embryos when inserted into an enucleated oocyte .
989	NoArgument	This was followed , in 2005 , by the birth of Snuppy , the world ’s first cloned dog .
990	Argument_against	The great majority of people have an intuitive sense that human beings should not be cloned .
991	NoArgument	I donï ¿ ½ t think this argument will ever be decided upon .
992	NoArgument	The kept alleging that things were impossible .
993	NoArgument	Most people would agree that I should wait those two months ; and , indeed , if I do not wait , many people would say that I acted wrongly .
994	NoArgument	At age 19 he has his first urinary tract infection because of an indwelling urinary catheter and continues to suffer from them the rest of his life .
995	NoArgument	Policy and social changes that protect lesbian and gay families are a much more pressing need .
996	Argument_against	If we engage in cloning , this objection goes , we run the risk of inserting our will too much into our procreative decisions ; we would get to choose not just to have a child , but what kind of child to have .
997	NoArgument	Maybe Iï ¿ ½ ve seen too many science fiction movies .
998	NoArgument	The portrayal of cloning in movies , television , and even in journalism has spanned from comedic to dangerous .
999	Argument_against	When a couple engages in sexual intercourse and produces a baby , the child is an “ offspring of a man and woman , but a replication of neither ; their offspring but not their product whose meaning and destiny they might determine ” ( Meilaender , 1997 , 42 ) .
1000	NoArgument	The writer , who had unexpectedly become a parent in his late thirties , describes his despair over his 11-month-old son 's death after heart surgery and 17 days of “ misery and struggle . ”
1001	NoArgument	It would also allow time for more extensive public debate and for the establishment of regulatory structures to prevent the gross abuse of any research cloning procedures that society might decide to allow .
1002	Argument_against	Man would be playing God and create people that are unable to feel and empathize .
1003	Argument_against	If this objection is successful , if recreating a pre-existing genetic code is intrinsically morally objectionable , then it would seem to present an objection to the actual cloning process .
1004	NoArgument	Advocating a moratorium on research cloning does not preclude support for continued work to overcome the technical difficulties .
1005	Argument_against	With the dignity of human life and it genetic uniqueness at risk , people might be cloned unwillingly , leaving millions of cells around every day as they go about their normal lives shedding skin .
1006	Argument_for	A clone would have access to a tremendous amount of information about his or her parent that could greatly help in understanding one 's psyche and physical attributes .
1007	NoArgument	U.S. Team Produces First Mule Clone . ”
1008	Argument_for	Though the possible medical benefits of cloning humans are still not fully known , it is argued that such a technology can completely transform the ways by which many disorders are being performed .
1009	Argument_for	To take a step towards immortality - Human cloning essentially means taking a human being 's DNA and reversing its age back to zero .
1010	NoArgument	Is it ethically questionable to clone humans in order to create new life ?
1011	Argument_against	Such a prospect raises concerns that cloning would facilitate viewing the resulting children as objects of manufacture , rather than as individuals with value and dignity of their own .
1012	NoArgument	I 'll leave these ethical and fuzzy questions to be answered by the reader .
1013	Argument_against	Dolly the sheep died in 2003 after having been euthanized due to her suffering from pulmonary adenomatosis , a disease fairly common in sheep that are kept indoors ; indeed , many members of Dolly ’s flock had succumbed to the same disease .
1014	Argument_against	Lastly , proponents of this objection ignore the very important role that nurture has in shaping a person ’s identity .
1015	NoArgument	All of this information could provide a better sense of identity .
1016	NoArgument	Scientists are either very close at being able to clone human beings , or scientists have already done so .
1017	Argument_against	In doing so , we run the risk of relegating children to the status of mere possessions or commodities , rather than regarding them as beings with their own intrinsic worth ( Harakas , 1998 ; Kass , 1998 ; Meilaender , 1997 ) .
1018	NoArgument	He goes to a pool party to celebrate .
1019	NoArgument	This means a person could literally become the parent of their own twin sibling or the parent of anyoneï ¿ ½ s twin .
1020	NoArgument	If you possess a negative right to x , this entails only one obligation on the behalf of others : the obligation to not obstruct your obtainment of x. For example , if I have a negative right to life , what this entails is that others have an obligation to not kill me , since this obstructs or hinders my right .
1021	Argument_for	If this proves true , therapeutic tissues could be developed from existing embryonic stem cell lines rather than from cell lines customized for a particular patient .
1022	Argument_for	Pluripotent stem cells can also be used to test drug toxicity which could also diminish the chances of drug-related birth defects ( Boiani and Schöler , 2002 , 124 ) .
1023	NoArgument	If implantation is unsuccessful , the process is repeated .
1024	Argument_for	Religious Freedom - At least two religions , the Raelian Religion and the Summum Religion , believe in cloning as one of their tenets .
1025	NoArgument	As abovementioned , CC the cat neither looks nor acts like Rainbow , her genetic predecessor .
1026	Argument_for	It aids in faster recovery from traumatic injuries .
1027	NoArgument	Therefore , a categorical ban on SCNT affects not just the prospect of reproductive cloning , but also the research that could be done with cloned embryos .
1028	Argument_for	Because cloning may provide the only way for some individuals to have a child that is genetically their own , a ban on cloning interferes with their reproductive autonomy .
1029	Argument_against	On the other hand , I believe that if same sex couples want a child , then adoption should be a better option as mentioned above .
1030	NoArgument	In addition to its slight genetic difference , the cloned embryo would likely be gestated in a different uterine environment , which can also have an effect in ways that may serve to distinguish it from its genetic predecessor .
1031	NoArgument	Another way to regard it is that a negative right only requires passive obligations ( the obligation to not do something or to refrain from acting ) .
1032	Argument_for	Human cloning technology promises to cure many or all incurable diseases and the moral weight of the dying and infirm will undoubtedly sway the politicians more than the arguments of the healthy , who often remain ignorant of the potential of human cloning , because they have never been motivated by suffering to look desperately for a cure .
1033	Argument_for	We would have a head start on understanding the genetic component of a cloned child .
1034	Argument_for	These all bring hope to people eager for children but unable to have their own or adopt .
1035	Argument_against	Embryos Killed : During the human cloning process , a lot of human embryos are created and tested for viability .
1036	NoArgument	He suffers chronic unbearable pain .
1037	NoArgument	Human cloning is a blunt form of eugenics-it " copies " an existing genome-while inheritable genetic modification allows the creation of " designer babies " through manipulation of individual genes .
1038	Argument_for	Not only that , but because the organ is , in fact , your own organ , there would be less chance of rejection .
1039	Argument_for	On the other hand , advances in science and technology would grow at an even faster rate and more people would be healthier .
1040	Argument_for	We may be able to cure cancer if cloning leads to a better understanding of cell differentiation .
1041	NoArgument	“ Should We Clone Humans ? ”
1042	NoArgument	“ Why I Oppose Human Cloning . ”
1043	NoArgument	She was named CC , short for “ Copy Cat , ” and was born at the College of Veterinary Medicine at Texas A&M University .
1044	NoArgument	While many people go through their lives never having a special relationship with another person , there are stories of twins in which they are so close they are perhaps psychically connected .
1045	NoArgument	Kass , Leon ( 1998 ) , “ The Wisdom of Repugnance : Why We Should Ban the Cloning of Humans ” in Ethical Issues in Human Cloning .
1046	NoArgument	Moreover , there is much evidence that , usually , the general public rejects genetic determinism ( Hopkins , 1998 ) .
1047	Argument_for	In order to overcome the immune rejection problems associated with organ and tissue transplants , stem cells would have to be obtained from embryos produced from a patient 's own cells , by means of research cloning .
1048	Argument_for	Much of it relates to helping human families gain children , but there is also a benefit for the animal world .
1049	NoArgument	In 2001 , the first feline created via somatic cell nuclear transfer was born .
1050	NoArgument	He never marries or has children .
1051	NoArgument	Kant , Immanuel ( 1981 ) , Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals .
1052	NoArgument	What is most striking about CC is not simply her mere existence , but also that CC does not look nor act like her feline progenitor , Rainbow .
1053	Argument_against	In the “ Instruction on Respect for Human Life in Its Origin and on the Dignity of Procreation , ” the Catholic Church denounces all forms of reproductive technology on the grounds that reproductive creation is strictly God ’s domain ( Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , 1987 ) .
1054	Argument_for	Using cloning technologies , genetic researchers would have a better understanding of the composition of genes and the effects of genetic constituents on human traits .
1055	NoArgument	The men would only require a surrogate to carry the clone until birth .
1056	NoArgument	At age 21 he inherits a 10 million dollar trust fund .
1057	Argument_for	This will diminish the waiting list for organ donations and allow more people to be saved .
1058	Argument_for	At age 40 after hearing about Dolly being a clone , he changes his will and has his DNA stored for future human cloning .
1059	Argument_against	Will cloning , thus , compromise a child ’s identity ?
1060	NoArgument	Golombok , Susan et al. ( 1995 ) , “ Families Created by the New Reproductive Technologies : Quality of Parenting and Social and Emotional Development of the Children . ”
1061	NoArgument	The term “ therapeutic cloning ” is , however , more widely used .
1062	NoArgument	This will eliminate the need to do an incision in back of the scalp for donor hair and will literally give the patient MORE hair . "
1063	NoArgument	However , inciting differentiated nuclei to behave as undifferentiated nuclei was thought to be impossible , since the conventional wisdom at the time was that once a cell was differentiated ( e.g. , once it became a cardiac cell , a liver cell , or a blood cell ) it could never reverse into an undifferentiated state .
1064	Argument_against	Because all children deserve to have a life and a future that is completely open to them in terms of its prospects ( Feinberg , 1980 ) , and because being the product of cloning would necessarily deprive the resulting child of these prospects , cloning is seriously immoral .
1065	Argument_against	The more “ artificial ” conception becomes , the more the resulting children will be seen as the possessions of the parents , rather than as persons in their own right .
1066	NoArgument	Some questions that arise are : Why did these individuals regard the recreation of the same DNA to equate to the recreation of the same entity that had died ?
1067	NoArgument	For this reason human cloning should be allowed .
1068	NoArgument	Response 1 : Negative vs. positive right to procreate .
1069	NoArgument	The result is that the genes behave in ways that may lead to a difference in appearance .
1070	Argument_for	As you can see , I think each and every reason to ban human cloning was logically contradicted or challenged .
1071	NoArgument	By cloning humans , it will be possible for potential parents to actually choose particular traits for their children .
1072	Argument_against	Many individuals regard the human embryo as a person with moral rights , and so they consider its destruction to be morally impermissible .
1073	NoArgument	Cloning is not to be equated with genetic modification or enhancement ( Wachbroit , 1997 ; Strong , 1998 ) .
1074	Argument_for	A cure for baldness - From one of our readers : " But how about the possibility of using cloning technology to get more hair on a balding scalp .
1075	Argument_against	In fact , over 90 % of human cloning attempts have been labeled as “ failure ” , which means that the human DNA is only put at risk during the process .
1076	NoArgument	Worse , being infertile is often not considered a " real medical problem " and insurance companies and governments are not sympathetic .
1077	NoArgument	Hence , limiting access to certain types of assisted reproductive technologies to an otherwise infertile couple would not necessarily infringe on their ( negative ) right to procreate ( Courtwright and Doron , 2007 ) .
1078	Argument_for	When scientists wish to replicate a specific gene to facilitate more thorough study , molecular cloning is implemented in order to generate multiple copies of the DNA fragment of interest .
1079	Argument_against	At least 95 % of mammalian cloning experiments have resulted in failures in the form of miscarriages , stillbirths , and life-threatening anomalies ; some experts believe no clones are fully healthy .
1080	NoArgument	This will be true only if we allow it to be true .
1081	NoArgument	Interestingly enough , however , a few minutes into the program , the narrator , speaking over a picture of two identical cows , says : “ But even if a clone person is created , that does n’t mean it would be an exact copy of the original . ”
1082	Argument_against	Cloned children would unavoidably be raised " in the shadow " of their nuclear donor , in a way that would strongly tend to constrain individual psychological and social development .
1083	Argument_against	Even attempting to perfect human reproductive cloning would entail a trial and error approach that would lead to the destruction of many embryos , and may produce severely disabled children before a healthy one is born .
1084	NoArgument	Since religion often comes into play with regards to this controversial matter , there emerge very passionate opinions that are not necessarily based on facts , but rather emotional .
1085	Argument_against	Along with the ability to clone desired traits , there could be the possibility of people deliberately reproducing undesired traits .
1086	Argument_against	It can bring forth a reduced sense of individuality .
1087	Argument_against	If a patient were to receive stem cell therapy in order to treat some affliction , her body may reject the stem cells for the same reason human bodies have a tendency to reject donated organs : the body tends to not recognize , and therefore reject , foreign cells .
1088	NoArgument	Take an introduction to biology with an online class .
1089	Argument_for	For couples who have unfortunately lost their children , should not they be given the chance to replace their loved ones with clones , if possible ?
1090	NoArgument	A cloned child would be gestated in a different uterine environment .
1091	NoArgument	It has seen a lot of failure .
1092	NoArgument	Quoted in : BBC News .
1093	Argument_for	The anti-cloners also seemed to feel that they had the ability to predict the timing and course of science advancement , which history has shown to be folly .
1094	NoArgument	However , there is much evidence to counter this claim .
1095	NoArgument	The three anti-cloners came across as people who would destroy hope .
1096	NoArgument	Our talents and desires are genetic , developmental , and environmental .
1097	NoArgument	In 1928 , Spemann successfully cloned a salamander using nuclear transfer .
1098	Argument_for	The technology can potentially help cure certain disorders , by replacing damaged tissues and organs within the human body .
1099	Argument_for	Cloning human body parts guarantees a genetic match to prevent organ rejections and also does not require immunosuppressive drugs .
1100	NoArgument	Additionally , she suffered from arthritis .
1101	Argument_against	Sexual Orientation : Some people want to ban human cloning because they believe this is the only method that homosexuals can have children that will most likely be homosexual too .
1102	NoArgument	Let us take a look at the pros and cons of cloning humans to come up with a well-informed decision on our end .
1103	Argument_against	Rev. Stanley Harakas puts this point as follows : “ Cloning would deliberately deny by design the cloned human being a set of loving and caring parents .
1104	NoArgument	I have only harmed an individual if I had made her worse off than she otherwise would have been had it not been for my actions .
1105	Argument_for	Restrictions on research cloning could postpone therapies beneficial to millions of people .
1106	NoArgument	Yet these parents are not prohibited from procreating because of this .
1107	Argument_against	It interferes with nature .
1108	NoArgument	Whatever these opinions are based upon , religion is definitely a motivating factor that keeps many people from agreeing with such a technology .
1109	Argument_against	If cloning could be perfected and used for this limited group , it would be all but impossible to prevent its use from spreading .
1110	Argument_against	It was for this reason that , for a long time , creating a cloned embryo from adult somatic cells was thought to be impossible – it would require taking long-time differentiated cells and getting them to behave like the totipotent cells ( cells that are able to differentiate into any cell type , including the ability to form an entirely distinct organism ) found in newly fertilized eggs .
1111	Argument_against	The Center for Genetics and Society believes that when all the arguments are considered together the case for allowing human cloning is not compelling , and that the harms of doing so are great .
1112	NoArgument	First , doubts can be cast as to whether this confusion would really ensue .
1113	NoArgument	Medical tragedies - Many people have suffered accidental medical tragedies during their lifetimes .
1114	NoArgument	In this process , the specific DNA fragment is transferred from one organism into a self-replicating genetic element , e.g. , a bacterial plasmid ( Allison , 2007 ) .
1115	Argument_for	Living on through a later-born twin - Some childless people feel that by being cloned by their later-born twin would help them or their DNA to live on in the same sense that people who have children live on .
1116	NoArgument	Are such concerns grave enough to permanently ban reproductive cloning altogether ?
1117	Argument_against	Women 's health advocates are concerned about the health and social justice implications of creating a market for human eggs in which most donors are likely to be poor women .
1118	Argument_for	People question their right to bring a child that technically is n't related to them into a lifestyle that falls below societies views of normal ..... human cloning could allow two gay men to take 23 chromosomes from each male and put them into a single egg to truly have a baby of their own .
1119	Argument_against	95 % of animal cloning has ended in failure due to genetic defects , and cloning is considered unsafe because of it .
1120	Argument_against	Indeed , safety concerns led the National Bioethics Advisory Commission ( 1997 ) to recommend a temporary , rather than permanent , moratorium on human reproductive cloning .
1121	Argument_against	These boundaries are set by either God ( and therefore cloning is wrong because it is “ playing God ” ) or nature ( and therefore cloning is wrong because it is “ unnatural ” ) .
1122	NoArgument	This means that sex , eye color and other characteristics can be selected and not left up to chance .
1123	Argument_for	No longer would there be the worry of scientists harming creatures because these creatures would be cloned specifically for the purpose of research .
1124	NoArgument	Another response is that Kant ’s dictum is misapplied .
1125	NoArgument	Response 2 : Forgetting nurture .
1126	NoArgument	His DNA clone will inherit a trust fund .
1127	NoArgument	Tooley , Michael ( 1998 ) , “ The Moral Status of Cloning Humans ” in Human Cloning : Biomedical Ethical Review .
1128	Argument_for	However , not everyone is physically capable of procreating through traditional modes of conception .
1129	Argument_against	The prospect of creating a child , solely to meet the needs of another child and not for her own sake , reduces the created child to a mere means to achieve the ends of the parents and the sick child .
1130	Argument_for	However , it is only because of the possible medical advances and the possible advantages to the human race that human cloning should be allowed .
1131	NoArgument	Women are made to feel as if they are useless barren vessels .
1132	NoArgument	Whereas Rainbow , a calico , is stocky and has patches of tan , orange , and white throughout her body , CC barely resembles a calico at all .
1133	NoArgument	A positive right requires more from obligation-bearers ; it requires that active steps be taken in order to provide the right-bearers with the means to fulfill that right .
1134	NoArgument	More than one person has written the Human Cloning Foundation ( including a twin that feels close to her identical twin ) that since a clone is virtually the equivalent of an identical twin , they suspect a very special relationship would exist between a clone and its DNA parent .
1135	Argument_against	Therapeutic cloning is controversial because isolating the stem cells from the embryo destroys it .
1136	Argument_for	Economics - Countries that fail to research human cloning will suffer economically .
1137	NoArgument	Because so many people want cloning - Please read the dozens of essays by people from all over the world in support of human cloning and published by the Human Cloning Foundation .
1138	Argument_against	The child would be destined to live in the shadows of her genetic predecessor ( Holm , 1998 ) .
1139	NoArgument	The previous year ’s work , which led to the birth and survival of Megan and Morag , used more than 200 embryos .
1140	NoArgument	From the time that an ovum is fertilized and syngamy ( the fusion of two gametes to form a new and distinct genetic code ) has successfully taken place , there exists a subject , the embryo , which is a bearer of dignity , moral status , and moral rights .
1141	NoArgument	Even if a cloned child did display certain behavioral traits belonging to her genetic predecessor , it is unclear whether the similarity in traits entails that a child ’s future would be closed off .
1142	Argument_against	This conditional respect may support the permissibility of prohibiting human cloning for reproductive purposes .
1143	Argument_against	Sub-Human : Imagine a new race of people that are docile with super strength yet low intelligence .
1144	NoArgument	They reminded me of the same types of people who proclaimed that cloning was impossible years ago .
1145	NoArgument	Even if there were such confusion , however , would it be so detrimental as to warrant banning reproductive cloning altogether ?
1146	NoArgument	Steinbock , Bonnie and Ron McClamrock , ( 1994 ) “ When Is Birth Unfair to the Child ? ”
1147	NoArgument	Some are either discarded or frozen for future use .
1148	NoArgument	However , since key religious texts ( e.g. , The Bible , The Torah , or the Qu ’ ran ) make no mention of such advancements , it is presumably impossible to determine what God would have to say about them .
1149	Argument_against	Moreover , because the embryos are created with the explicit intention to destroy them , there are concerns that this treats the embryos in a purely instrumental manner ( Annas et al. , , 1996 ) .
1150	NoArgument	Like many of the arguments against reproductive cloning listed below , this argument in favor of cloning , despite its emotional appeal , erroneously assumes that genetic determinism is true .
1151	Argument_against	The cloned human being would not be the product of love , but of scientific procedures .
1152	Argument_against	You can leave skin cells even on a computer keyboard , and those cells could be used to clone you if cloning becomes a reality .
1153	Argument_for	Research cloning will be necessary in order to produce compatible tissues and organs for patients being treated with stem cell therapies .
1154	Argument_against	Although he rejects the contention that clones would not be considered persons , Thomas Shannon expresses concerns that the increasing artificiality of conception , not just via the use of cloning , but via the use of all forms of artificial reproductive technologies , will “ transform our thinking about ourselves , and the transformation will be in a mechanistic direction ” ( Shannon and Walter , 2003 , 134 ) .
1155	NoArgument	As humans continually reproduce , damage to their DNA lines increases .
1156	NoArgument	Religion : I believe it is impossible for anyone to know the true intentions of God if God exists .
1157	NoArgument	It explores some classic stereotypes of human clones , and it illustrates how many of these stereotypes can be traced back to media portrayals about human cloning .
1158	Argument_for	Dr. Richard Seed , one of cloning 's leading proponents , hopes that cloning will help us understand how to reverse DNA back to age 20 or whatever age we want to be .
1159	Argument_against	The technology of cloning humans is already here , as evidenced by Dolly the sheep , but it called forth questions about the role of God in society , the soul and even the quality of life a cloned individual would have .
1160	Argument_against	Without a system of strict public oversight and control , some of the clonal embryos created in laboratories are likely to wind up being used for reproductive purposes .
1161	Argument_against	There is also the belief that these clones would be created without a soul .
1162	Argument_for	Cloning would be a step towards a fountain of youth .
1163	NoArgument	Response 1 : Assuming genetic determinism .
1164	NoArgument	Some people believe in one religion and others in another .
1165	Argument_against	Super Humans : Selecting the most perfect genetic donor in someoneï ¿ ½ s opinion , whether it is Albert Einstein , Michael Jordan , or some other above average person , changes the norms of society .
1166	Argument_for	Though treatments for infertility these days are somehow successful , cloning can reached even greater heights , like being able to take cloned cells to create a younger twin of a father or a mother .
1167	NoArgument	If the child is cloned with the intent to serve as the social child of her genetic predecessor , she would be , genetically , her social mother ’s twin sister ( or his social father ’s twin brother ) , and her social grandparents ’ genetic daughter .
1168	Argument_against	It might decrease the overall value of human life .
1169	Argument_for	Many scientists hope that , with proper research and application , embryonic stem cells can be used to treat a wide variety of afflictions , e.g. , tissue toxicity resulting from cancer therapy ( National Cancer Institute , 1999 ) Alzheimer ’s disease ( Gearhart , 1998 ) , Parkinson ’s disease ( Freed et al , 1999 ; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Strokes , 1999 ; Wager et al. 1999 ; Gearhart , 1998 ) , diabetes ( Voltarelli et al , 2007 ; Shapiro et al. , 2000 ) , heart disease ( Lumelsky , 2001 ; Zulewski , 2001 ) , and limb paralysis ( Kay and Henderson , 2001 ) .
1170	Argument_against	Rather than being considered persons , the likelihood is that these cloned human beings would be considered ‘ objects ’ to be used ” ( 1998 , 89 ) .
1171	NoArgument	According to Wilmut , “ Dolly was derived from 277 embryos , so the other 276 did n’t make it .
1172	NoArgument	In 1951 , Robert Briggs and Thomas Kling , using Spemann ’s methods of embryonic nucleus transfer , successfully cloned frogs .
1173	Argument_against	There are concerns that cloned humans would lack individuality , that they would be treated in undignified ways by their creators , or that they would be damaged by society ’s expectations that they should be more like those from whom they were cloned .
1174	Argument_against	Reproductive cloning would foster an understanding of children , and of people in general , as objects that can be designed and manufactured to possess specific characteristics .
1175	NoArgument	We can pass strong laws making reproductive cloning illegal without banning research cloning .
1176	NoArgument	The two lines of research go hand in hand and should complement each other .
1177	Argument_against	Dan Brock further supports the contention that cloning in order to replace a deceased child is misguided ( Brock , 1997 ) .
1178	Argument_against	The claim is that a cloned child would be in danger of suffering from severe genetic defects as a result of being a clone , or that cloning would result in a high number of severely defective embryos before one healthy human embryo is developed .
1179	NoArgument	A summary comment follows at the end of the arguments .
1180	Argument_against	When parents do not like the children they have got , then they would just go clone another one in the hopes of getting it perfect the next time around .
1181	Argument_against	Moreover , because parents have cloned this child with the expressed purpose of replacing a deceased child , the expectations that the new child will be just like the deceased one would be overwhelming and impede the child ’s ability to develop her own individuality ( Levick , 2004 ) .
1182	NoArgument	Yet , if I were to wait two months , my ailment would pass and I would conceive a perfectly healthy baby .
1183	NoArgument	Edited by Michael C. Brannigan .
1184	Argument_for	Because this kind of cloning does not result in the genesis of a human organism , it has no reproductive intent or goals , and it does not result in the creation and destruction of embryos , there is little to no contention regarding its use .
1185	NoArgument	If a person were to believe that genetic determinism is true , then it follows that she believes that a cloned person would be psychologically identical with her genetic predecessor because they are ( almost ) genetically identical .
1186	Argument_for	Cloning is a reproductive right , and should be allowed once it is judged to be no less safe than natural reproduction .
1187	Argument_for	It may also be possible to use therapeutic cloning to repair defective genes by homologous recombination ( Doetschman et al. , 1987 ) .
1188	NoArgument	It is just a completely wrong idea for the many .
1189	Argument_for	Cloning humans is an innovative method that is an extremely powerful tool to bring about a huge change for the entire world .
1190	Argument_for	Cloned embryos are said to be needed for research on embryonic stem cells that promise to revolutionize medicine .
1191	NoArgument	: It Depends on Your Religion . ”
1192	NoArgument	Coming to an agreement on this hot subject is not easy , but understanding it deeply can lead to some level of clarity .
1193	Argument_against	Perfection of techniques to create clonal human embryos would make it more difficult to prevent the births of human clones .
1194	Argument_for	In other words , the Wolfs ( and the woman who cloned Nicky ) were willing to spend an exorbitant amount of money to clone their pets not just in order to receive another pet , but to , rather , receive what was , in their eyes , the same pet that they had lost ( Masterson , 2010 ) .
1195	NoArgument	Response 1 : No such confusion is likely to arise .
1196	Argument_against	Would there be any defense against people collecting cells and cloning random people ?
1197	NoArgument	This objection appears to be an incarnation of the objection from the Right to an Open Future .
1198	NoArgument	Will these expectations transfer over to human cloning , where people will regard cloned children as the same individuals as their genetic predecessors , and therefore treat them with this expectation in mind ?
1199	NoArgument	Thomas Murray continues his article by disclosing that he too is a grieving father , having suffered the death of his twenty-year-old daughter who was abducted from her college campus and shot .
1200	Argument_against	Many people feel strongly the cloning humans is completely wrong , with the state of the technology at the moment possibly involving a huge number of damaged pregnancies to achieve a single live baby clone .
1201	Argument_for	Your body would recognize the new organ as your own .
1202	NoArgument	The embryos are then transferred into a womb and , upon successful implantation and gestation , are born as identical multiples .
1203	Argument_against	Cloning a child to be a reincarnation of someone else is a grotesque , fun-house mirror distortion of parental expectations ” ( 2001 ) .
1204	NoArgument	Kitcher , Phillip ( 1997 ) , “ Who ’s Self is it Anyway ? ”
1205	Argument_against	According to some ethicists who oppose human cloning , a cloned child ’s identity and individuality will be compromised given that she will be “ saddled with a genotype that has already lived ” ( Kass , 1998 , 56 ; see also Annas , 1998 and Kitcher , 1997 ) .
1206	Argument_against	In other words , even granting that individuals have a positive right to procreate , it does not follow from this alone that they should be provided with any means necessary for successful procreation .
1207	NoArgument	In biology , the activity of cloning creates a copy of some biological entity such as a gene , a cell , or perhaps an entire organism .
1208	NoArgument	Discover a mathematical way to observe biology with an online course .
1209	Argument_against	Any treatments that rely upon cloning techniques would be very expensive , and likely unaffordable to large majorities of people .
1210	NoArgument	The images and not-very-clever headlines all convey unsettling messages that clones will be exact copies , while inside the stories go to some effort to educate us that clones will not in fact be exact copies ” ( 1998 , 129-130 ) .
1211	Argument_for	There is also the likely ability to alter genetic constituents in cloned humans , and cloning could help combat genetic diseases .
1212	Argument_for	Perfection of cloning techniques would open the door to even more powerful technologies of human genetic modification .
1213	NoArgument	Gurdon ’s successful use of differentiated nuclei , rather than the embryonic nuclei used by Briggs and Kling , was particularly surprising to the scientific community .
1214	Argument_against	Even a Discovery Channel program , meant to educate its viewers on the nature of cloning , initially portrays a clone as nothing more than a duplicate of the original person .
1215	Argument_against	Reproductive cloning would diminish the sense of uniqueness of an individual .
1216	NoArgument	If harm is defined as making someone worse off than she otherwise would have been , it is difficult to maintain that I harmed the resulting child by my actions , even if she were impaired .
1217	Argument_for	Not only that plants and animals can be revived with cloning , but also humans can be cloned to offer potential benefits to other people who are living .
1218	Argument_against	The technique could not be developed in humans without putting the physical safety of the clones and the women who bear them at grave risk .
1219	NoArgument	You want your clone to lead the life that was meant to be yours - The Human Cloning Foundation has been surprised by the number of people that write to say that they would like to have a clone so that it may lead the life that was meant to be theirs .
1220	Argument_against	Arguments against cloning appeal to concerns about a clone ’s lack of genetic uniqueness and what may be implied because of this .
1221	Argument_for	Endangered species could be saved - Through the research leading up to human cloning we will perfect the technology to clone animals , and thus we could forever preserve endangered species , including human beings .
1222	Argument_against	No child should have to bear the oppressive expectation that he or she will live out the life denied to his or her idealized genetic avatar … .
1223	NoArgument	Response 2 : Assuming genetic determinism ( again ) .
1224	Argument_against	Though it might seem like a scenario straight from a sci-fi film that people might use clones for unlawful interests and crime , it is still possible if human cloning takes a common place in society .
1225	Argument_against	Expectations : Expectations of cloned humans to be identical to the genetic original person would undoubtedly cause a lot of psychological pressure , especially while growing up .
1226	Argument_against	Scientists believe this lack of diversity will lower the human race ’s ability to adapt .
1227	Argument_against	Perhaps the more charitable understanding is that “ playing God ” is morally wrong when it comes to cloning because it is a process that artificially creates life , outside of the practice of sexual intercourse ( Meilaender , 1997 ) .
1228	Argument_for	Animals and plants could be cloned for medical purposes - Through the research leading up to human cloning , we should discover how to clone animals and plants to produce life-saving medications .
1229	NoArgument	One interesting point is that both detractors of cloning ( e.g. , Kass and Callahan , whose views are explored below ) and supporters of cloning ( like the researcher that read this letter at the congressional hearing ) find convergence in committing the same fallacy .
1230	Argument_for	Using the person ’s own cells , they will be able to recover that much faster and that much easier .
1231	Argument_for	As long women give informed consent and are fairly compensated , markets in human eggs should not be seen as a bad thing .
1232	NoArgument	Applied to preconception choices , Parfit ’s argument can be applied as follows .
1233	Argument_against	They may not be entitled to the use of a certain technological advancement ( e.g. , SCNT ) if that advancement is deemed to pose a danger to the resulting offspring .
1234	Argument_for	Scientists believe that embryonic stem cell research will lead to cures for many diseases and will provide tissues and organs for transplant and treatment of degenerative conditions .
1235	Argument_for	To be a better parent - Human cloning can improve the parent-child relationship .
1236	Argument_against	Because of the expectations that the cloned child will re-live the life of her genetic predecessor , the child would necessarily be deprived of her right to an open future .
1237	Argument_against	Large scale research cloning could generate a market for women 's eggs that could easily lead to exploitation .
1238	NoArgument	A negative right to x means that no one has the prima facie right to interfere in your request to fulfill x .
1239	Argument_against	Typically , those who offer the second response ( e.g. , the Catholic Church ) regard the human embryo as a complete moral subject upon conception ( Pope John Paul II , 1995 ; Pope Paul VI , 1968 ) , and therefore any experiment that harms them or destroys them is morally tantamount to any experiment that would destroy a person .
1240	Argument_against	According to this objection , our DNA is what endows each human being with uniqueness and dignity ( Callahan , 1993 ) .
1241	Argument_for	It could be used to understand the genetic contribution to disease and to test vast arrays of new drugs which could not be tested in human people ” ( Savulescu , 2007 , 1-2 ) .
1242	Argument_for	Theories exist about how cloning may lead to a cure for heart attacks , a revolution in cosmetic surgery , organs for organ transplantation , and predictions abound about how cloning technology will save thousands of lives .
1243	Argument_for	And finally with further research , it could be possible to decrease the number of embryos created to only a single embryo .
1244	Argument_against	The reasons for doing any action must out weigh the reasons for not doing the action , therefore cloning a person should not be because of capability .
1245	NoArgument	One day in the not too far distant future , Japan may realize its mistake .
1246	NoArgument	His future mother will be awarded one million dollars to have him and raise him .
1247	NoArgument	It gives a new meaning to genetic modification .
1248	Argument_for	Unlike therapeutic cloning , the cloned embryo is transferred into a uterus of a female of the same species and would be , upon successful implantation , allowed to gestate as a naturally fertilized egg would .
1249	Argument_against	Yet cloning , Murray continues , “ can neither change the fact of death nor deflect the pain of grief ” ( 2001 ) .
1250	NoArgument	What about replacing an aged body with a new body by transplanting the human brain ?
1251	NoArgument	Levick , Stephen ( 2004 ) , Clone Being : Exploring the Psychological and Social Dimensions .
1252	NoArgument	Finally , as is evident from children raised by adoptive parents , social parents usually retain the honorific role as the child ’s “ real ” parents , even though there are no genetic ties between them and the adopted child .
1253	NoArgument	This intuitive response , however , is surprisingly tricky to defend .
1254	NoArgument	Find out the pros and cons , and decide for yourself if cloning is worth the risks .
1255	Argument_for	Indeed , it is precisely because of these ethical issues that some individuals object to the positive connotations of the term “ therapeutic ” and refer to this work , instead , as “ research cloning . ”
1256	Argument_against	As such , there would be a lack of diversity in humankind .
1257	Argument_for	One way to overcome stem cell rejection is by creating embryos through somatic cell nuclear transfer with the patient ’s own DNA .
1258	NoArgument	No one claims that identical multiples ’ right to a unique genetic identity was compromised simply in virtue of their creation , which calls into question whether such a right exists in the first place ( Silver , 1998 ; Tooley , 1998 ; Rhodes , 1995 ) .
1259	Argument_against	The predominate theme underlying arguments against human cloning is that the cloned child would undergo some sort of physical , social , mental , or emotional harm .
1260	Argument_for	A Child 's right to be better than its parents - It 's been suggested that parents have a duty to see that their children have better lives than they do .
1261	NoArgument	Read an interesting article on questions for the GCSE exam .
1262	Argument_against	" Replacing " the deceased child by cloning degrades and dehumanizes the child , its replacement , and all of us .
1263	NoArgument	Cohen , Cynthia ( 1996 ) , “’ Give Me Children or I ’ll Shall Die ! ’
1264	Argument_against	If genes are modified to create beings who are smarter than others , the average person will not have a place in society .
1265	Argument_for	Using their own cells , they would be given the chance to truly heal with less complications .
1266	NoArgument	Response 1 : Faulting cloning for the misconceptions of others .
1267	Argument_for	Just the research of human cloning alone could save a great many lives .
1268	NoArgument	The article summarizes the different types of cloning , such as recombinant DNA/molecular cloning , therapeutic cloning , and reproductive cloning .
1269	NoArgument	Because an older cell is often being used to create a human clone , there is the possibility that this imprinted age could be placed on the growing embryo .
1270	NoArgument	While it will always unethical to kill another human being to save another person , what if the cloned human body replacement did not have a brain and was intentionally designed that way from the beginning ?
1271	Argument_against	If a particular type of reproductive technology poses a health risk to the resulting children , this is grounds enough to prevent the use of that technology ( Cohen , 1996 ) .
1272	Argument_for	Curing Diseases : The growing scientific field known as regenerative medicine , also known as therapeutic cloning , is allowing thousands of lives to be saved from cloning human cells , tissues , and even organs .
1273	Argument_against	With human cloning on the rise , it is greatly possible that human beings would become more of a commodity than an individual .
1274	Argument_for	But cloning technologies are needed if inheritable genetic modification is to become commercially practicable .
1275	NoArgument	“ Are Scientists Playing God ?
1276	Argument_for	Reproductive cloning could allow parents of a child who has died to seek redress for their loss .
1277	NoArgument	This article discusses the biological , historical , and moral aspects of cloning mammals .
1278	Argument_for	Third , embryos can also be used in stem cell research , and thus possibly save human lives .
1279	NoArgument	Moreover , it is not just parents of cloned children that may be guilty of violating the child ’s right to an open future ; many parents are , to varying degrees of severity , already guilty of violating such a right with their naturally created children , and often times those attempts are subject to failure ( see Agar , 2004 , 106 for such an example ) .
1280	Argument_for	To make a future couple financially secure - With human cloning you could give a couple in the future both a child from your DNA and the financial assets from your lifetime to start out financially secure instead of struggling as most couples do now .
1281	NoArgument	Wilmut , Ian et al. ( 1997 ) , “ Viable Offspring Derived from Fetal and Adult Mammalian Cells . ”
1282	NoArgument	At its core , however , this objection assumes the very controversial thesis that either a person ’s genes play an almost fatalistic role in her life decisions , or that individuals in society will assume some robust version of genetic determinism to be true and will treat cloned children according to that assumption .
1283	Argument_against	Reproductive cloning is inherently unsafe .
1284	Argument_for	Those who fail to begin research right away will fall behind .
1285	NoArgument	Were they alcoholic , child-beating molesters ?
1286	Argument_for	Moreover , those who have made significant contributions to science , the arts , music and literature would be ideally cloned to produce more of them to contribute more of their works .
1287	NoArgument	This is only science fiction now , yet it may some day be a possibility in the distant future .
1288	Argument_against	Many philosophers and ethicists who would otherwise support reproductive cloning concede that concern for the safety of children born via cloning is reason to caution against its use ( Harris , 2004 ; Glannon , 2005 ) .
1289	NoArgument	In addition to somatic cell nuclear transfer , there is another , less controversial and less technologically complex , manner of reproductive cloning : artificial embryo twinning .
1290	NoArgument	Voltarelli , Julio C. ( 2007 ) , “ Autologous Nonmyeloablative Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Newly Diagnosed Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus . ”
1291	Argument_for	Cloning techniques will eventually be perfected in mammals and will then be suitable for human trials .
1292	Argument_against	However , whereas in the objection from the Right to an Open Future , the cloned child is deprived of individuality based on the perception of others ( and , as is developed above , this does not seem to really be an objection to the practice of cloning simpliciter ) , this objection indicates that there is something inherently individuality-compromising , and therefore dignity-compromising , in recreating an existing genetic code .
1293	NoArgument	However , it is unclear why generating a child via somatic cells is more likely to foster despotism than when the child is generated using germ cells .
1294	NoArgument	Did you never have a chance ?
1295	NoArgument	Advocates of the “ playing God ” objection have the onus to define exactly what “ playing God ” means .
1296	Argument_against	Human Rights : A lot of people worry that cloned people would not have full rights , since they are just copies .
1297	Argument_against	It might be used for exploitation .
1298	Argument_against	The anti-cloners made the case for stem cell research while alleging that cloning itself would not result in any major scientific breakthroughs .
1299	NoArgument	In other words , what defines a parent seems to have less to do with genetics and more to do with who performs the social role of mother and father ( Purdy , 2005 ) .
1300	NoArgument	We have success rates of roughly one in a hundred or less ” ( Klotzko , 1998 , 134 ) .
1301	NoArgument	All these people favor cloning and want the science to proceed .
1302	NoArgument	Richard T. Hull ( ed . )
1303	NoArgument	March 25 , 1999 , “ What Would You Hope to Achieve from Stem Cell Research ? ”
1304	NoArgument	“ Genetic Savings and Clone ” was founded by Lou Hawthorne , who was seeking a means to clone his family ’s beloved dog Missy .
1305	Argument_for	Procreative liberty is a right well established in Western political culture ( Dworkin , 1994 ) .
1306	Argument_for	It could eliminate defective genes .
1307	NoArgument	If you know a good reason why human cloning should be allowed please write it as an essay and submit it at our FORUM
1308	Argument_against	Another way of explaining it is that creating a child solely for the purposes of providing life-saving aid for another child violates Immanuel Kant ’s second principle formulation of the categorical imperative .
1309	NoArgument	Kant proscribes treating persons as a mere means , rather than as ends in themselves , maintaining that persons should “ act in such a way that [ humanity is treated ] always at the same time as an end and never simply as a means ” ( 1981 , 36 ) .
1310	Argument_against	Callahan argues that there is something intrinsically identity-depriving , and therefore dignity-depriving , in duplicating a genetic code .
1311	NoArgument	( 2000 ) , “ Islet Transplantation in Seven Patients with Type I Diabetes Mellitus Using a Glucocorticoid-Free Immunosuppressive Regimen . ”
1312	NoArgument	One response is to distinguish between a positive right to procreate and a negative right to procreate ( Pearson , 2007 ) , and argue that reproductive liberty can be fully respected in the latter sense , and only conditionally respected in the former sense .
1313	Argument_against	Another common concern is that cloning is morally wrong because it oversteps the boundaries of humans ’ role in scientific research and development .
1314	Argument_for	While I believe that pre-determining the sex of a child is not applicable in modern society , I find no logically moral reasons why this should be banned .
1315	NoArgument	Genetic illnesses are not a leading killer of people today , but they could be in the near future .
1316	Argument_for	Embryonic stem cells appear less likely to stimulate rejection after transplantation than other cell types .
1317	Argument_against	If society wishes to ban inheritable genetic modification it can and should do so .
1318	NoArgument	Bad parents - Did your parents destroy your life ?
1319	Argument_against	Tis would cause premature aging issues and potentially lead to premature death .
1320	Argument_for	Parents that have lost a child can have that child returned to them with a clone .
1321	NoArgument	For the child that would have been born two months later would not have been the same child that is born if I do not wait ; the impaired child would never have existed had I waited those two months .
1322	Argument_for	Other recent research suggests that it may eventually be possible to achieve similar results by " reprogramming " some of the patient 's own cells .
1323	NoArgument	Although Missy died before she was successfully cloned , Hawthorne banked her DNA in the hopes of ultimately succeeding in this endeavor .
1324	NoArgument	Unfortunately , I have not seen or heard a holistic explanation of both sides with all the reasons for and against human cloning , so I am going to list all the reasons that Iï ¿ ½ ve found so far .
1325	Argument_for	This reason is self defeating ; because as scientists learn more , cloning humans has the possibility of becoming safer than naturally developing embryos by replacing randomized risks and genetic defects .
1326	Argument_against	Response 2 : A child is not replaceable .
1327	NoArgument	Proposals for commercially practicable inheritable genetic modification ( " designer babies " ) call for the use of cloning techniques to create embryos using stem cell nuclei that have been previously genetically modified .
1328	NoArgument	The predominate belief that fuels this conception is that genetic determinism is true , i.e. , that a person ’s genes are the sole determining factor of her behavior and physical appearance ; essentially , that a person ’s identity is solely determined by her genetic constitution .
1329	Argument_for	One advantage to doing this is that the later born twin could serve as a blood or bone marrow donor for her older sibling should the need arise ; because they are genetically identical , the match would be guaranteed ( the converse could also hold , that is , the older individual could serve as a donor for the clone should the latter ever need it .
1330	NoArgument	Furthermore , there has been quite a bit of legislation proposing to completely ban human cloning , and a large amount of legislation proposing to allow human cloning .
1331	Argument_against	However , there is a possibility that the age of the donor could be imprinted on the growing embryo .
1332	NoArgument	Hopkins also points out that , like the narrator in the Discovery Channel program , many media outlets “ engage in confusing , contradictory bits of double-talk ( or double-show ) .
1333	NoArgument	Yet , given that we have evidence that the robust form of genetic determinism these arguments assume is false ( Resnik and Vorhaus , 2006 ; Elliot , 1998 ) , both detractors and supporters of cloning who rely on it produce faulty arguments .
1334	Argument_against	Also , the implications of what happens when the process goes wrong are still not fully understood , which is not good and could lead to problems that we will not be able to handle .
1335	Argument_for	You can read about many of the expected medical benefits in the essay " The Benefits of Human Cloning . "
1336	Argument_for	When it comes to infertile couples , should not they be granted the opportunity to produce clones of themselves ?
1337	NoArgument	( To our knowledge the type of reproduction described here has not yet been done , but someday it will probably be possible . )
1338	Argument_for	Restricting any sort of medical research is unacceptable .
1339	Argument_for	To cure infertility - Infertile people are discriminated against .
1340	NoArgument	Using genetic alteration in plants and animals , researchers can replicate organisms needed for research .
1341	Argument_against	The tacit implication here is that cloning is desirable because it somehow presents a way to cheat death .
1342	Argument_against	Also , evidence suggests that clones often have built-in genetic defects and are unhealthy , which can lead to premature ageing and even death .
1343	NoArgument	In 2005 , two endangered gray wolves were cloned in Korea ( Oh et al. , 2008 ) .
1344	Argument_against	Embryos at Risk : The process of human cloning increases the risk of harm to embryos and thus to the cloned person throughout their life .
1345	NoArgument	Deckers , Jan ( 2007 ) , “ Are Those Who Subscribe to the View that Early Embryos are Persons Irrational and Inconsistent ?
1346	NoArgument	If you cloned yourself , the resulting child would be neither your son or daughter nor your twin brother or sister , but a new category of human being : your clone .
1347	Argument_against	Any method of procreation that does not implement traditional modes of conception , i.e. , not involving the union of sperm and ova , is guilty of one ( or both ) of these infractions ( Goodman , 2008 ; Tierney , 2007 ) .
1348	NoArgument	Body Replacements : One of the stranger reasons for cloning humans is for a complete body replacement .
1349	NoArgument	For example , it is physically possible for a child to have as many as six distinct “ parents ” : three genetic parents ( the mitochondrial DNA donor , the somatic cell donor used to re-nucleate an enucleated ovum , and the sperm donor ) , one gestational parent , and two ( perhaps even more ) social parents .
1350	NoArgument	However , the strongest evidence against this claim is the existence of identical multiples , who are , in essence , clones of nature ( Pence , 2004 ; Gould , 1997 ) .
1351	NoArgument	It can cause a divide among people .
1352	Argument_against	As older cells are often used to create human clones , it is possible that their imprinted age could be adopted by the growing embryos , which can then create some premature aging issues and , potentially , even premature death .
1353	NoArgument	Courtwright , Andrew M. and Wechsler Doron ( 2007 ) , “ Is Restricting Access to Assisted Reproductive Technology an Infringement of Reproductive Rights ? ”
1354	NoArgument	For example , a cloned entity ’s phenotype ( its appearance ) may look very different than that of its genetic predecessor because the embryo can undergo epigenetic reprogramming , where nongenetic ( i.e. , environmental ) causes influence genes to manifest themselves differently .
1355	NoArgument	She would have different friends , attend different schools , play different games , watch different television shows , listen to different music .
1356	Argument_against	As you can see , human DNA can be contaminated , and the chances of success are very rare .
1357	NoArgument	Even if technology were created in which your memories and thoughts could be transmitted to the clone , your clone would still be a different person .
1358	Argument_for	If human cloning is completely banned , then this type of research would be stopped and a lot of lives would be lost .
1359	NoArgument	Both assume that cloning recreates identity , and they differ only as to the desirability of that consequence .
1360	Argument_against	Therefore , deliberate conception , gestation , and birthing of a child with mental , physical , or developmental impairments does not , usually , harm the child ( unless the impairments are so bad that they make the child ’s life worse than not having existed at all ) .
1361	Argument_against	It goes against religious ethics .
1362	NoArgument	Nature via Nurture : Genes , Experience , and What Makes Us Human .
1363	Argument_against	Even if cloning were safe , it would be impossible to allow reproductive cloning for lesbians or gay men without making it generally available to all .
1364	Argument_against	That is , the move away from natural conception towards artificial conception will lead to humans collectively regarding themselves as more machine-like rather than as organic beings .
1365	Argument_against	Certainly the concerns are similar : that a cloned child would be deprived of her own individual identity because of her genetic origins .
1366	Argument_against	Though human clones would be a brand new set of life with unique preferences , a loss of individuality is still potential , as clones would be simply twins of someone else , regardless of the age of that other person might be .
1367	NoArgument	There is no clear information on who will have control over who gets cloned , and firms are already making money from storing tissues from dead partners and children until the time when human cloning becomes widely available .
1368	NoArgument	Basically , human cloning is the artificial process of making a genetic twin of a person .
1369	NoArgument	The main area of concentration is the moral dimensions of reproductive cloning , specifically the use of cloning in order to procreate .
1370	NoArgument	First , it is heavily debated if killing a human embryo that is only a few living cells is murdering a person .
1371	Argument_against	Human clones have often been depicted in movies as nothing but carbon copies of their genetic predecessor with no minds of their own ( e.g. , Multiplicity and Star Wars : Attack of the Clones ) , as products of scientific experiments that have gone horribly wrong , resulting in deformed quasi-humans ( Alien Resurrection ) or murderous children ( Godsend ) , as persons created simply for spare parts for their respective genetic predecessor ( The Island ) , or as deliberate recreations of famous persons from the past who are expected to act just like their respective predecessor ( The Boys from Brazil ) .
1372	NoArgument	That is , the obligation becomes an active one as well as a passive one : an obligation to not destroy my life and also to provide services that enable me to preserve my life .
1373	Argument_for	Endangered animals can be cloned to save the species .
1374	NoArgument	Cloning requires the use of women 's eggs , typically ten or more for each attempt .
1375	NoArgument	Brannigan , Michael ( ed . )
1376	NoArgument	After a brief history of the development of cloning technology , the article considers arguments for and against reproductive cloning .
1377	NoArgument	The ovum is then artificially induced to begin dividing as if it had been naturally fertilized ( usually via the use of an electrical current ) .
1378	Argument_for	As humans reproduce continually , there is also an increase in damage to their DNA lines , creating defective and mutated genes , which could be eliminated by cloning healthy human cells .
1379	NoArgument	The second response applies not just to therapeutic cloning , but to any type of embryo experimentation .
1380	Argument_for	Cloning may be the only way for an otherwise infertile couple to have a genetically related child .
1381	NoArgument	Pence , Gregory ( 2008 ) , Classic Cases in Medical Ethics : Accounts of Cases That Have Shaped and Define Medical Ethics .
1382	Argument_against	In their article “ Genetic Modification and Genetic Determinism , ” David Resnik and Daniel Vorhaus state that , when it comes to genetic modification , “ even if a desired trait is successfully expressed it may not actually restrict options for the child … the open future critique paints with a far broader brush , alleging that the act of modification per se impacts the child 's right to an open future .
1383	Argument_against	There are many more arguments against reproductive cloning , but this is a brief list of the main arguments .
1384	Argument_for	Same sex couples can have children without the use of donor sperm or donor eggs .
1385	NoArgument	In America , some people believe gun control and some do n't .
1386	NoArgument	For example : A boy graduates from high school at age 18 .
1387	Argument_for	Alan and Kristine Wolf paid thousands of dollars to have their deceased cat , Spot , cloned from skin cells they had preserved .
1388	Argument_against	Plus , there would be a lack of diversity in the world leading to everyone looking the same .
1389	NoArgument	Hope - On the Charlie Rose television show on February 14th , 2001 , three anti-cloners debated against one reporter .
1390	NoArgument	Even most of the reasons to allow human cloning were opposed too .
1391	Argument_for	One possible use of reproductive cloning technology is to help save endangered species ( Lanza et al. , 2000 ) .
1392	NoArgument	Additionally , I am going to address each of these issues on their rational merit .
1393	NoArgument	In other words , Wilmut and Campbell were able to take a fully differentiated adult cell and revert it back to an undifferentiated , totipotent , state .
1394	Argument_against	Because cloning recreates a pre-existing DNA sequence , the cloned child would be denied that uniqueness and , therefore , her dignity would be compromised .
1395	Argument_against	It would violate deeply and widely held convictions concerning human individuality and freedom , and could lead to a devaluation of clones in comparison with non-clones .
1396	Argument_against	And I 've said , I would breathe a sigh of relief if either the Supreme Court or the states themselves began to eliminate the death penalty .
1397	NoArgument	10/31/2016 - We thank the teachers in 8,369 schools that have used our free resources in your instructional materials .
1398	Argument_against	Our capital punishment system is unreliable .
1399	NoArgument	What is life like for Zacarias Moussaoui , the member of the September 11 hijacking teams who got caught a month before the attack ?
1400	Argument_against	Second of all , thousands of attorneys have made their personal crusade in life the stomping out of the death penalty .
1401	NoArgument	The defects in death-penalty laws , conceded by the Supreme Court in the early 1970s , have not been appreciably altered by the shift from unrestrained discretion to " guided discretion . "
1402	NoArgument	Some are knifed , shot , or assaulted ( Internet ) .
1403	NoArgument	No one expects the prosecutor to pursue every possible offense or punishment , nor do we expect the same sentence to be imposed jus t because two crimes appear similar .
1404	Argument_against	We as a society have to move away from the " eye for an eye " revenge mentality if civilization is to advance .
1405	Argument_against	Mentally ill patients may be put to death .
1406	NoArgument	This is not a realistic prospect : our legal system will never reverse itself to deny defendants the right to counsel , or the right to an appeal .
1407	Argument_against	Evidence shows execution does not act as a deterrent to capital punishment .
1408	NoArgument	But death is not realized .
1409	NoArgument	Unfortunately , the murderer has deprived his family and friends of a loved one .
1410	Argument_against	Whether it 's a firing squad , electric chair , gas chamber , lethal injection , or hanging , it 's barbaric to allow state-sanctioned murder before a crowd of people .
1411	Argument_against	The death penalty is the only actually irrevocable penalty .
1412	Argument_against	There is considerable evidence that many mistakes have been made in sentencing people to death .
1413	NoArgument	Even the perpetrators should be given this privilege .
1414	Argument_against	[ quoting C.J. Warren from Trop v. Dulles , 356 U.S. 86 , 101 ( 1958 ) ] I therefore would hold , on that ground alone , that death is today a cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Clause ... I would set aside the death sentences imposed ... as violative of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments . "
1415	NoArgument	It is a prominent factor in the availability of counsel .
1416	Argument_for	A system in place for the purpose of granting justice can not do so for the surviving victims , unless the murderer himself is put to death .
1417	NoArgument	And if — as the left tirelessly maintains — poverty breeds crime , and if — as it tiresomely maintains — the poor are disproportionately minority , then it must follow — as the left entirely denies — that minorities will be ' overrepresented ' among criminals . "
1418	Argument_against	CON : " ... Since the reinstatement of the modern death penalty , 87 people have been freed from death row because they were later proven innocent .
1419	NoArgument	The murdering pedophile is given the death penalty , but will probably spend ten years beforehand in prison .
1420	NoArgument	Scores of these individuals were sentenced to death .
1421	Argument_against	In relation to free will , some criminals are suffering from mental illness or are having clouded judgment at the time of the crime .
1422	NoArgument	When the assailant is apprehended and charged , he has the power of the judicial process who protects his constitutional rights .
1423	Argument_against	And why do poor people get the death penalty ?
1424	NoArgument	They donï ¿ ½ t have to fear the death penalty .
1425	NoArgument	And , God help us all if that ever gets to be easy . "
1426	NoArgument	The number of criminal cases that are plea bargained ( meaning the accused admits guilt in return for a lesser sentence or some other concession ) can be as high as 80 or 90 percent of cases .
1427	NoArgument	Those who kill whites are more likely to be sentenced to die than those who kill African-Americans .
1428	NoArgument	Karla Faye Tucker One of the few women put to death , she sparked several debates over capital punishment .
1429	NoArgument	Therefore , how can one even have time to think of fear in the heat of passion ( Internet ) ?
1430	NoArgument	Seanï ¿ ½ s murder is still unsolved , and the killer is enjoying his life somewhere .
1431	Argument_against	Yet we say that teaching people to respond to violence with violence will , again , only breed more violence .
1432	NoArgument	It 's no secret that anti-Americanism is rampant around the world .
