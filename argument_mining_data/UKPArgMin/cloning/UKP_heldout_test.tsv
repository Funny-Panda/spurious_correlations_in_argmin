0	NoArgument	The same would be said of clones .
1	Argument_for	Since the embryo was a genetic duplicate of the patient , there would be no immunological rejection .
2	Argument_against	Moreover , advocates of this objection caution against removing God from the process of creation altogether , which , it is argued , is what reproductive cloning achieves ( Rikfin , 2000 ) .
3	Argument_against	It is unethical to experiment on an embryo for the same reason it is unethical to experiment on any human being and since embryo experimentation often results in the destruction of the embryo , this equates to murdering the embryo ( Deckers , 2007 ; Oduncu , 2003 ; Novak , 2001 ) .
4	Argument_for	To fund research - People whose lives have been destroyed or have not been able to reproduce in this lifetime due to tragedy could arrange to have their DNA continued and fund research at the same time .
5	Argument_against	That is , while we ought not to prevent anyone from procreating , we are not required to provide them with any technology whatsoever in order to enable them to procreate if they can not do so by their own means .
6	NoArgument	Natural reproduction can itself produce dangerous results .
7	NoArgument	The industrial revolution and Internet revolutions enriched the United States of America .
8	Argument_against	One possible definition of “ playing God ” is that anything that interferes with nature , or the natural progression of life , interferes with God ’s plan for humanity , and is therefore morally wrong .
9	NoArgument	In SCNT , an ovum is emptied of its own nucleus , its DNA , and the chromosomal DNA from another person ( in the case , a patient ’s ) is inserted .
10	NoArgument	Would human cloning help society at large ?
11	NoArgument	Therefore , no one should have any expectations from cloned people .
12	NoArgument	Annas , George et al. ( 1996 ) , “ The Politics of Human-Embryo Research – Avoiding Ethical Gridlock . ”
13	NoArgument	Here , an embryo is created in a Petri dish via In Vitro Fertilization ( IVF ) .
14	NoArgument	Technical information about the production of cloned human embryos could not and should not be suppressed .
15	NoArgument	Taking a look at it from both sides and comparing its pros and cons can give us a different perspective .
16	Argument_for	I judge this purpose as a sufficiently good enough reason for allowing human cloning ; however , I am very suspicious of intentionally making a better race of people .
17	NoArgument	I know that the Catholic Pope is against cloning , but I find that at odds with being fruitful and multiplying .
18	Argument_for	Mankind is already " playing " God when we cure diseases , fly airplanes , create nuclear energy , or use any advanced technology .
19	NoArgument	If I have a positive right to life , for instance , it is not just that others have an obligation to not kill me ; they have a further obligation to provide me with any services that I would need to ensure my survival .
20	NoArgument	Because I did not harm her , I did not do anything morally wrong in this circumstance .
21	Argument_against	Research cloning is likely to be too costly to be used in the course of routine medical procedures .
22	Argument_for	Cloning has the potential to change the world for infertile couples almost overnight .
23	Argument_for	In a free society , people have the right to pursue any scientific-and especially medical-investigation .
24	Argument_against	That is , in order for advocates of this objection to be consistent , they should be equally willing to ban other forms of reproductive technology that may result in harm to potential offspring .
25	NoArgument	Some of the arguments are religious in nature .
26	NoArgument	Recently , the controversy around human cloning has received a lot of news coverage ; yet unsurprisingly , a clear and thorough examination of both sides has been lacking from the news media .
27	Argument_for	also two gay women could use this technology to conceive a child of their own using their individual 23 chromosomes . "
28	Argument_against	In a sense , this objection maintains that a cloned child would either lack the free will to live her life according to her own desire and goals or that , at the very least , her free will would be severely restricted by her parents or the society that has certain expectations of her given her genetic lineage .
29	Argument_for	For example cloning can be used to get more hair from a few sample hair follicles or grafts from the patient 's head and then grow them .... later transplant the grafts where it is needed .
30	NoArgument	Randall Curren ( ed . )
31	NoArgument	Human society can accept or reject any proposed technology on its own merits .
32	Argument_against	Also , it could create new societal division , where perfect clones would be treated in a different way than those who are naturally born .
33	Argument_for	The process of transplanting human organs can become simpler , with an immensely improved success rate .
34	Argument_against	Ian Wilmut , Dolly ’s creator , has denounced human reproductive cloning as too dangerous to attempt ( Travis , 2001 ) .
35	NoArgument	Furthermore , there is an immense difference between a woman 's desire to terminate an unwanted pregnancy and the desire to create a genetic duplicate of another person .
36	NoArgument	Illmensee , Karl et al. ( 2009 ) , “ Human Embryo Twinning with Applications in Reproductive Medicine . ”
37	Argument_against	The child ’s very desire to be different from her predecessor illustrates that she is not destined to be like her predecessor .
38	NoArgument	While the debate about cloning humans is ongoing , how do you feel about it ?
39	Argument_against	In addition , anything that thwarts the natural process of conception ( i.e. , birth control ) may also be morally condemned .
40	Argument_against	People who have strong religious beliefs generally oppose the process of cloning humans , as they feel that it would result in man becoming the creator , changing the authority of a supreme being .
41	NoArgument	In return , however , its advantages are also quite apparent .
42	NoArgument	Many other media outlets , although usually shying away from the ominous representation of clones so prevalent in the movies , have usually portrayed clones as , essentially , facsimiles of their genetic predecessor .
43	Argument_for	For example , the February 19 , 2001 cover shows two mirror image infants staring at each other , the tagline suggesting that cloning may be used by grieving parents who wish to resurrect their dead child .
44	NoArgument	She would also likely be raised in a much different society ( e.g. , a child born in 2010 would have vastly different social influences than a child born in the 1960s or 1970s ) .
45	Argument_against	They said that this form of interference is decidedly wrong and can lead to a domino effect , which means that other attributes of life could be changed or altered negatively as a result .
46	NoArgument	They think that it would be completely wrong to bring children into the world knowing that they can be affected by these problems .
47	Argument_against	Because cloning involves the artificial process of recreating a pre-existing genetic code , prospective parents could , first , choose their child ’s DNA ( thereby creating a “ designer child ” ) , and , second , because they are creating a “ replica ” of an existing person , they will consider the child more akin to property than an individual in her own right .
48	Argument_against	Many believe that cloning is against God ’s wishes because the clones would be created by man .
49	Argument_against	It risks the possibility of faster aging .
50	NoArgument	Create an A + Biology research paper with an online class .
51	Argument_for	One argument in favor of artificial embryo twinning is that it provides an infertile couple , who may not have been able to produce many viable embryos through IVF , with more embryos that they can then implant for an increased chance at successful reproduction ( Robertson , 1994 ) .
52	NoArgument	The room was quiet as Boisselier read the man 's words : “ I decided then and there that I would never give up on my child .
53	NoArgument	“ Double-Blind Controlled Trial of Human Embryonic Dopamine Cell Transplants in Advanced Parkinson ’s Disease : Study , Design , Surgical Strategy , Patient Demographics , and Pathological Outcome ” ( presented to the American Academy of Neurology ) .
54	NoArgument	Since Dolly , many more mammals have been cloned through the use of SCNT .
55	NoArgument	For people who became quadriplegic due to horrific traffic accidents and professional athletes who tore their ACLs , recovery time could be long or it is even impossible for them to get back to their original state .
56	NoArgument	Brigitte Boisselier , a chemist working with couples who want to use cloning techniques to create babies , read aloud a letter from “ a father ( Dada ) . ”
57	NoArgument	Access to affordable healthcare is a general social issue , not specific to research cloning .
58	NoArgument	There is no inconsistency between supporting the former and opposing the latter .
59	Argument_against	Even if a clone were to appear healthy at birth , there are concerns about health problems arising later in life .
60	NoArgument	The concept of a “ savior sibling , ” a child that is deliberately conceived so that she could provide a means ( through the donation of bodily fluids , umbilical cord blood , a non-vital organ , or tissue ) to save an older sibling from illness or death is not new .
61	NoArgument	In a free society , people have the right to work together democratically to adopt policies that they believe contribute to building a better world .
62	Argument_for	Learning the process of reprogramming , differentiation , and dedifferentiation is likely to result in just as many medical miracles as stem cell research .
63	Argument_for	Cellular models of diseases can be developed as well , along with the ability to test drug efficacy : “ cloning a single skin cell from a patient with a disease could be used to produce inexhaustible amounts of cells and tissue with that disease .
64	NoArgument	The generational and historical differences between a clone and her genetic predecessor would undoubtedly go a long way when it comes to shaping the personality of the former ( Pence , 1998 ; Dawkins , 1998 ; Harris , 1997 ; Bor , 1997 ) .
65	Argument_for	Read about a girl who needs a kidney , a burn victim , a girl born with cosmetic deformities , a man who needs a liver , a woman who is infertile because of cancer , and a father who lost his only son .
66	NoArgument	Arguments offered for and against reproductive cloning are given below .
67	NoArgument	French , Andrew J. et al. ( 2008 ) , “ Development of Human Cloned Blastocysts Following Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer with Adult Fibroblasts . ”
68	Argument_against	Cloning children could foster an understanding that children can be designed and replicated to the parents ’ wishes .
69	Argument_for	Proposed therapeutic uses of cloning techniques would entail many millions of women 's eggs a year , a quantity that seems prohibitively large .
70	NoArgument	Only if I have harmed someone can my action be deemed morally wrong .
71	Argument_against	Because We Can : Just because science gives humanity the ability to do something does not mean that humankind should .
72	Argument_for	The current options for infertile couples are painful , expensive , and heart-breaking .
73	Argument_against	Next , imagine how easily for this race to fall into slavery .
74	Argument_against	Clones could be seen as less than human compared with non-clones .
75	NoArgument	Lumelsky , Nadya et al. ( 2001 ) , “ Differentiation of Embryonic Stem Cells to Insulin - Secreting Structures Similar to Pancreatic Islets , ” Science , 292 : 1389 – 1394 .
76	Argument_for	One of the most predominate themes underlying arguments for reproductive cloning is an appeal to procreative liberty .
77	Argument_against	The creation of cloned embryos would always be very labor intensive and expensive .
78	Argument_against	Creating a child for the sole purpose of saving another child violates the formula of humanity because the child is created specifically for this end .
79	NoArgument	Genetically speaking , a cloned child would be her genetic predecessor ’s identical twin sibling .
80	NoArgument	Human cloning is of special interest .
81	NoArgument	In a free society we know that we must tolerate some views that we do n't agree with so that we all may be free .
82	NoArgument	Once the embryo is approximately five days old , the stem cells are removed , cultured , differentiated to the desired type of body cell , and inserted back into the patient ( the genetic donor in this case ) .
83	Argument_against	There would be a lack of uniqueness and violate convictions regarding human individuality and freedom .
84	NoArgument	This was the position presented by Senator Arlen Specter in his proposed Senate Bill 2439 , called the “ Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2002 : A Bill to Prohibit Human [ Reproductive ] Cloning While Preserving Important Areas of Medical Research , Including Stem Cell Research . ”
85	Argument_against	In his article “ Even If It Worked , Cloning Wo n’t Bring Her Back ” , ethicist Thomas Murray recounts a letter he heard read at a congressional hearing regarding human reproductive cloning .
86	Argument_for	As most supporters of research cloning acknowledge , embryos created in IVF clinics can provide adequate numbers and varieties of stem cells for research purposes .
87	NoArgument	Response 2 : Knowing God ’s will .
88	Argument_against	Further , this argument appropriates the phrase " genetically related " to embrace a condition that has never before occurred in human history , one which abolishes the genetic variations that have always existed between parent and child .
89	NoArgument	In 1995 , Dr. Ian Wilmut and Dr. Keith Campbell successfully cloned two mountain sheep , Megan and Morag , from embryonic sheep cells .
90	Argument_for	It is an innovation that can change the world in a positive way .
91	NoArgument	Throughout history , parents who have lost children have grieved and sought consolation from family and community .
92	NoArgument	I believe that this reason is caused by fear from ignorance and religion and therefore logically baseless .
93	Argument_for	I find this reasoning absolutely ridiculous , since a person is a person despite their genetic source or if artificially created .
94	Argument_for	Second , extra embryos can be frozen , so they can avoid being killed too .
95	NoArgument	How Do You Feel About Human Cloning ?
96	Argument_for	Some twins describe their twin relationship as more wonderful and meaningful any other relationship in their lives .
97	NoArgument	So , would it help society at large or is it ethically questionable ?
98	NoArgument	There are two responses to this response .
99	Argument_for	Reproductive cloning would allow lesbians to have a child without having to use donor sperm , and gay men to have a child that does not have genes derived from an egg donor ( though , of course , a surrogate would have to carry the pregnancy ) .
100	NoArgument	Li , Ziyi ( 2006 ) , “ Cloned Ferrets Produced by Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer . ”
101	Argument_for	Medical technology has already improved our lives immensely , and we must support continued progress .
102	Argument_against	Given the evidence that genetic determinism is false , Murray further stresses that using cloning as a method of replacing a dead child “ is unfair .
103	NoArgument	Since identical twins are genetically the same yet very different people , it is unwise to expect cloned people to behave or have the same intelligence as the original genetic person .
104	NoArgument	In 2008 , a California research team succeeded in creating embryos via SCNT and growing them to the blastocyst stage ( French et al. , 2008 ) .
105	NoArgument	He confuses the deep end and shallow end and dives head first into the pool , breaking his neck and becoming a quadriplegic .
106	NoArgument	Most parents learn to communicate their expectations about their children in a moderate and ultimately positive way .
107	Argument_for	Japan has banned human cloning and will probably suffer by falling behind during the biotech revolution .
108	Argument_against	Children created by cloning would live in the shadow of the genetic donor , always having to live up to the expectations of a person they were created from .
109	Argument_for	It could eliminate infertility .
110	Argument_for	Reproductive cloning can provide genetically related children for people who can not be helped by other fertility treatments ( i.e. , who do not produce eggs or sperm ) .

112	NoArgument	Some examples are deer , ferrets ( Li et al. , 2006 ) , mules ( Lovgren , 2003 ) , other sheep , goats , cows , mice , pigs , rabbits , a gaur , dogs , and cats .
113	NoArgument	She would be born into either the same family , but with a different dynamic , as her genetic predecessor , or be born into a different family altogether .
114	NoArgument	Though they might look alike , twins have different personalities and enjoy different things .
115	NoArgument	You would have a head start on the needs and talents of your child .
116	Argument_against	This could lead to a rise in malpractices within society .
117	NoArgument	The embryo is then induced to divide into genetic copies of itself , thereby artificially mimicking what happens when monozygotic multiples are formed ( Illmensee et al. , 2009 ) .
118	Argument_against	When thinking about cloning children designed and replicated to the parents ’ wishes , consider the book My Sister ’s Keeper in which Anna is the product of preimplantation genetic diagnosis and is born for the sole purpose of being a bone marrow plant for her older sister Kate .
119	NoArgument	What laws would there be to defend your rights as the true non-clone compared to the clone ?
120	Argument_against	Some forms of human experimentation are already forbidden , as is the sale of organs for transplant .
121	Argument_for	Interestingly , human cloning allows you the opportunity to participate in choosing the parents for your clone .
122	NoArgument	Not only is she lanky and thin , she has a grey coat over a white body and is lacking the patches of orange or tan typical to calicos .
123	NoArgument	He leaves five million to spinal cord research .
124	NoArgument	On the several occasions which Time Magazine has addressed the issue of cloning , the cover illustrates duplicate instances of the same picture .
125	Argument_for	Because of their plasticity , embryonic stem cells can be manipulated to become any cell in the human body , e.g. , neural cells , retinal cells , liver cells , pancreatic cells , or heart cells .
126	Argument_against	One big drawback to cloning humans is its ability to divide people , where clones who are not treated as human beings can lead to social unrest and divide .
127	NoArgument	The same can be said about cloning ( Pence , 1998 and 2008 ; Wachbroit , 1997 ) .
128	Argument_against	Concerns over individuality have also been raised ; whereas naturally occurring twins are valued as individuals , one worry is that embryos created through artificial twinning , precisely because of the synthetic nature of their genesis , may not be as valued ( McCormick , 1994 ) .
129	NoArgument	And it is this claim that we reject ... ” ( 2006 , 9 ) .
130	Argument_for	Furthermore , they seemed happy and willing to take away the hope of infertile couples and others with severe diseases that human cloning technology might one day lessen their suffering or save their lives .
131	NoArgument	Response 1 : Clarifying the meaning of “ playing God . ”
132	Argument_against	While it is admirable that the parents wish to save their existing child , it is not ethically permissible to create another child solely as an instrument to save the life of her sibling ( Quintavalle , 2001 ) .
133	NoArgument	An important philosophical issue is whether such a response against human cloning is warranted .
134	Argument_against	Because cloning entails recreating an existing person ’s genetic code ( with the exception of the difference in mitochondrial DNA ) , some argue that cloning would , necessarily , entail a violation of the cloned child ’s right to a distinctive genetic identity ( European Parliament , 1998 ) .
135	NoArgument	There are personality differences between Rainbow and CC as well ; whereas Rainbow is described as a shy , reticent , and a more “ hands-off ” kind of cat , CC is described as more playful , inquisitive , and affectionate ( Hays , 2003 ) .
136	Argument_for	However , cloning their own cells can lower recovery time and true healing could occur .
137	NoArgument	Because of the special relationship that twins have - Twins often have very special relationships .
138	Argument_for	This means infertile couples can experience happiness of having their own families without enduring painful procedures to treat infertility that are common today .
139	Argument_for	I donï ¿ ½ t think God in any religion has directly banned human cloning .
140	Argument_against	If reproductive cloning is permitted to happen and becomes accepted , it is difficult to see how any other dangerous applications of genetic engineering technology could be proscribed .
141	NoArgument	In 2004 , a Texas woman paid $ 50,000 to clone her deceased Maine Coone Nicky and , as a result , Little Nicky , the world ’s first commercially cloned cat , was born .
142	NoArgument	He dies feeling that although he was robbed of normal life , his twin/clone will lead a better life .
143	Argument_for	There is no reason that individuals and society ca n't learn to embrace human clones as just one more element of human diversity and creativity .
144	NoArgument	This involved enucleating a single-celled salamander embryo and inserting it with the nucleus of a differentiated salamander embryonic cell .
145	NoArgument	One year later , in 1996 , Wilmut and Campbell successfully cloned the first mammal to be born from an adult somatic cell , specifically an udder cell ( a sheep ’s mammary gland ) : Dolly the sheep ( Wilmut et al. , 1997 ) .
146	Argument_for	It can cure some disorders .
147	Argument_for	We are not saying that a clone would be a carbon copy with no individuality .
148	NoArgument	Furthermore , they were able to create a viable pregnancy and produce from it a healthy lamb ( however , there were 276 failed attempts before Dolly was created , which , as it will be discussed below , creates concerns over the safety and efficacy of the procedure ) .
149	Argument_for	Human cloning has already become illegal or restricted in a variety of degrees in several countries , thus scientific research has been greatly reduced throughout the world .
150	NoArgument	I would never stop until I could give his DNA - his genetic make-up - a chance ” ( 2001 ) .
151	NoArgument	Weinberg , Rivka ( 2008 ) , “ Identifying and Dissolving the Non-Identity Problem . ”
152	Argument_for	One use of this technology , for example , is to help treat individuals in the aftermath of a heart attack .
153	Argument_against	Egg retrieval is a complicated procedure , involving courses of hormone treatments and significant risks for the woman .
154	Argument_against	Because of these and other concerns , the United Nations and many countries have banned human cloning .
155	Argument_against	Many opponents of the technology feel that its process is artificial and interferes with nature , even believing that the natural process of procreation is not something that should be corrected or altered in a way .
156	Argument_for	This may mean making our children live longer , helping them to be resistant to cancer , heart disease , any familial diseases , and all the other problems that can be cured using what we learn from human cloning technology .
157	NoArgument	This was the first time the process had been accomplished for mammalian reproduction .
158	Argument_for	Even when depicting nonhuman cloning , films ( such as Jurassic Park ) tend to portray products of cloning as menacing , modern-day Frankensteinian monsters of sorts , which serve to teach humans a lesson about the dangers of “ playing God . ”
159	Argument_for	For many people , this is a huge advantage and a great way to use science in a new light .
160	Argument_for	If clonal embryos free of reprogramming errors can be created , establishing pregnancies is likely to be a trivial procedure .
161	Argument_for	Raising a clone would be like having a child with an instruction manual .
162	NoArgument	Wakayama , Teruhiko et al. ( 1999 ) , “ Mice Cloned from Embryonic Stem Cells . ”
163	Argument_against	And since there is already a great deal of gap and difference in the world today , from race to social status , many people feel that human cloning can result to a new difference that will only cause more harm .
164	Argument_against	The resulting child , moreover , would most likely be identified as the victim of my actions .
165	NoArgument	At a certain point in time , it was considered as a profound achievement in biology , but this is no longer the case these days , as the number of its opponents are increasing , making such technology quickly becoming a heated topic in debates from all over the world .
166	NoArgument	The research that led to her creation was funded by the California based company “ Genetic Savings and Clone , ” who , between 2004 and 2006 , offered grieving pet owners a chance to clone their sick or deceased pets ( they closed their doors in 2006 due to the unsustainability of their business ) .
167	Argument_against	Adopting an orphan is much easier , cheaper , virtuous , and safer solution than trying to clone a human being , not including helping a child in need .
168	Argument_for	We can not allow delays in the development of techniques that could save lives or prevent suffering .
169	Argument_against	Imagine discovering that you are the clone of a child your parents lost , and you live your life always being compared to the dead child .
170	NoArgument	A child produced by cloning would be the genetic duplicate of an existing person .
171	Argument_for	Because the sick will demand it - Those resisting human cloning research will probably find themselves shouted down by the sick and the maimed who desperately need such research .
172	NoArgument	At age 20 he comes down with herpes zoster of the trigeminal nerve .
173	Argument_for	The existence of a cloned person , therefore , could be mutually beneficial , rather than asymmetrical ) .
174	Argument_for	It is likely that the anti-cloners are quite wrong .
175	Argument_for	It can also bring about the recreation of species that have long since died , allowing scientists to fully study the species as a living creature instead of simply looking at images or bones .
176	NoArgument	Take an online course in GCSE Biology .
177	NoArgument	In 1902 , Hans Spemann cloned a salamander embryo through inducing twinning as well , using a hair from his infant son as a noose to divide the embryo .
178	Argument_for	Those countries that jump in first will reap the rewards .
179	Argument_for	Biotechnology will lead the next economic revolution .
180	NoArgument	This is the deeper and more far-reaching motivation behind much of the advocacy of human cloning .
181	NoArgument	In 1962 , John Gurdon announced that he too had successfully cloned frogs but , unlike Briggs and Kling ’s method , he did so by transferring differentiated intestinal nuclei from feeding tadpoles ( Wilmut et al. , 2000 ) .
182	NoArgument	As an example : Japan failed to jump on the Internet bandwagon and is now playing catch-up .
183	NoArgument	Boyle , Robert and Julian Savulescu ( 2001 ) “ Ethics of Using Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis to Select a Stem Cell Donor for an Existing Person . ”
184	NoArgument	From the ones that do implant , approximately 2 % to 3 % of newborn infants suffer from congenital abnormities of varying degrees of severity ( Kumar et al. , 2004 ) .
185	Argument_against	Because they would essentially be facsimiles of the original person , there is concern that the clones might possess less moral worth .
186	NoArgument	Gay couples - From one of our readers : " gay couples go through so much ... not to mention all the controversy ... when they decide that they are ready for a baby .
187	Argument_against	Rights are socially negotiated , and no " right " to clone oneself has ever been established .
188	Argument_for	Considering that identical twins are natural clones , we can regard reproductive cloning as the technological version of the process .
189	NoArgument	Yet almost immediately afterwards , the same narrator calls a clone “ You , version 2.0 . ”
190	Argument_against	It is speculated that human cloning could eventually be used as a means to exploit people for other people ’s vested interests .
191	Argument_against	These factors will contribute to viewing and treating the child as a mere commodity .
192	NoArgument	This supports Kass ’ claim that many people may expect a cloned child to be like her genetic predecessor .
193	Argument_against	Do humans have a soul , which would be lost during the process ?
194	Argument_against	Is this a way for humanity to try to replace God ?
195	Argument_against	If Callahan ’s concerns were accurate , identical multiples would fail to be individuals in their own right , and , consequently , be harmed because of this .
196	Argument_for	It is considered as the logical next step in reproductive technology .
197	NoArgument	The studies conducted by Golombok certainly seem to provide evidence to the contrary .
198	Argument_against	But this is too vague ; humans constantly interfere with nature in ways that are not morally criticized .
199	NoArgument	However , this research is still in its infancy and requires a lot more time , effort , and money before it matures into saving a lot more people .
200	Argument_against	Some studies suggest that research cloning may not be a necessary or desirable way to overcome immune rejection .
201	NoArgument	Because embryonic cells are undifferentiated , and therefore extremely malleable , it was not too surprising that transferred embryonic nuclei produced distinct embryos when inserted into an enucleated oocyte .
202	NoArgument	This was followed , in 2005 , by the birth of Snuppy , the world ’s first cloned dog .
203	Argument_against	The great majority of people have an intuitive sense that human beings should not be cloned .
204	NoArgument	I donï ¿ ½ t think this argument will ever be decided upon .
205	NoArgument	The kept alleging that things were impossible .
206	NoArgument	Most people would agree that I should wait those two months ; and , indeed , if I do not wait , many people would say that I acted wrongly .
207	NoArgument	At age 19 he has his first urinary tract infection because of an indwelling urinary catheter and continues to suffer from them the rest of his life .
208	NoArgument	Policy and social changes that protect lesbian and gay families are a much more pressing need .
209	Argument_against	If we engage in cloning , this objection goes , we run the risk of inserting our will too much into our procreative decisions ; we would get to choose not just to have a child , but what kind of child to have .
210	NoArgument	Maybe Iï ¿ ½ ve seen too many science fiction movies .
211	NoArgument	The portrayal of cloning in movies , television , and even in journalism has spanned from comedic to dangerous .
212	Argument_against	When a couple engages in sexual intercourse and produces a baby , the child is an “ offspring of a man and woman , but a replication of neither ; their offspring but not their product whose meaning and destiny they might determine ” ( Meilaender , 1997 , 42 ) .
213	NoArgument	The writer , who had unexpectedly become a parent in his late thirties , describes his despair over his 11-month-old son 's death after heart surgery and 17 days of “ misery and struggle . ”
214	NoArgument	It would also allow time for more extensive public debate and for the establishment of regulatory structures to prevent the gross abuse of any research cloning procedures that society might decide to allow .
215	Argument_against	Man would be playing God and create people that are unable to feel and empathize .
216	Argument_against	If this objection is successful , if recreating a pre-existing genetic code is intrinsically morally objectionable , then it would seem to present an objection to the actual cloning process .
217	NoArgument	Advocating a moratorium on research cloning does not preclude support for continued work to overcome the technical difficulties .
218	Argument_against	With the dignity of human life and it genetic uniqueness at risk , people might be cloned unwillingly , leaving millions of cells around every day as they go about their normal lives shedding skin .
219	Argument_for	A clone would have access to a tremendous amount of information about his or her parent that could greatly help in understanding one 's psyche and physical attributes .
220	NoArgument	U.S. Team Produces First Mule Clone . ”
221	Argument_for	Though the possible medical benefits of cloning humans are still not fully known , it is argued that such a technology can completely transform the ways by which many disorders are being performed .
222	Argument_for	To take a step towards immortality - Human cloning essentially means taking a human being 's DNA and reversing its age back to zero .
223	NoArgument	Is it ethically questionable to clone humans in order to create new life ?
224	Argument_against	Such a prospect raises concerns that cloning would facilitate viewing the resulting children as objects of manufacture , rather than as individuals with value and dignity of their own .
225	NoArgument	I 'll leave these ethical and fuzzy questions to be answered by the reader .
226	Argument_against	Dolly the sheep died in 2003 after having been euthanized due to her suffering from pulmonary adenomatosis , a disease fairly common in sheep that are kept indoors ; indeed , many members of Dolly ’s flock had succumbed to the same disease .
227	Argument_against	Lastly , proponents of this objection ignore the very important role that nurture has in shaping a person ’s identity .
228	NoArgument	All of this information could provide a better sense of identity .
229	NoArgument	Scientists are either very close at being able to clone human beings , or scientists have already done so .
230	Argument_against	In doing so , we run the risk of relegating children to the status of mere possessions or commodities , rather than regarding them as beings with their own intrinsic worth ( Harakas , 1998 ; Kass , 1998 ; Meilaender , 1997 ) .
231	NoArgument	He goes to a pool party to celebrate .
232	NoArgument	This means a person could literally become the parent of their own twin sibling or the parent of anyoneï ¿ ½ s twin .
233	NoArgument	If you possess a negative right to x , this entails only one obligation on the behalf of others : the obligation to not obstruct your obtainment of x. For example , if I have a negative right to life , what this entails is that others have an obligation to not kill me , since this obstructs or hinders my right .
234	Argument_for	If this proves true , therapeutic tissues could be developed from existing embryonic stem cell lines rather than from cell lines customized for a particular patient .
235	Argument_for	Pluripotent stem cells can also be used to test drug toxicity which could also diminish the chances of drug-related birth defects ( Boiani and Schöler , 2002 , 124 ) .
236	NoArgument	If implantation is unsuccessful , the process is repeated .
237	Argument_for	Religious Freedom - At least two religions , the Raelian Religion and the Summum Religion , believe in cloning as one of their tenets .
238	NoArgument	As abovementioned , CC the cat neither looks nor acts like Rainbow , her genetic predecessor .
239	Argument_for	It aids in faster recovery from traumatic injuries .
240	NoArgument	Therefore , a categorical ban on SCNT affects not just the prospect of reproductive cloning , but also the research that could be done with cloned embryos .
241	Argument_for	Because cloning may provide the only way for some individuals to have a child that is genetically their own , a ban on cloning interferes with their reproductive autonomy .
242	Argument_against	On the other hand , I believe that if same sex couples want a child , then adoption should be a better option as mentioned above .
243	NoArgument	In addition to its slight genetic difference , the cloned embryo would likely be gestated in a different uterine environment , which can also have an effect in ways that may serve to distinguish it from its genetic predecessor .
244	NoArgument	Another way to regard it is that a negative right only requires passive obligations ( the obligation to not do something or to refrain from acting ) .
245	Argument_for	Human cloning technology promises to cure many or all incurable diseases and the moral weight of the dying and infirm will undoubtedly sway the politicians more than the arguments of the healthy , who often remain ignorant of the potential of human cloning , because they have never been motivated by suffering to look desperately for a cure .
246	Argument_for	We would have a head start on understanding the genetic component of a cloned child .
247	Argument_for	These all bring hope to people eager for children but unable to have their own or adopt .
248	Argument_against	Embryos Killed : During the human cloning process , a lot of human embryos are created and tested for viability .
249	NoArgument	He suffers chronic unbearable pain .
250	NoArgument	Human cloning is a blunt form of eugenics-it " copies " an existing genome-while inheritable genetic modification allows the creation of " designer babies " through manipulation of individual genes .
251	Argument_for	Not only that , but because the organ is , in fact , your own organ , there would be less chance of rejection .
252	Argument_for	On the other hand , advances in science and technology would grow at an even faster rate and more people would be healthier .
253	Argument_for	We may be able to cure cancer if cloning leads to a better understanding of cell differentiation .
254	NoArgument	“ Should We Clone Humans ? ”
255	NoArgument	“ Why I Oppose Human Cloning . ”
256	NoArgument	She was named CC , short for “ Copy Cat , ” and was born at the College of Veterinary Medicine at Texas A&M University .
257	NoArgument	While many people go through their lives never having a special relationship with another person , there are stories of twins in which they are so close they are perhaps psychically connected .
258	NoArgument	Kass , Leon ( 1998 ) , “ The Wisdom of Repugnance : Why We Should Ban the Cloning of Humans ” in Ethical Issues in Human Cloning .
259	NoArgument	Moreover , there is much evidence that , usually , the general public rejects genetic determinism ( Hopkins , 1998 ) .
260	Argument_for	In order to overcome the immune rejection problems associated with organ and tissue transplants , stem cells would have to be obtained from embryos produced from a patient 's own cells , by means of research cloning .
261	Argument_for	Much of it relates to helping human families gain children , but there is also a benefit for the animal world .
262	NoArgument	In 2001 , the first feline created via somatic cell nuclear transfer was born .
263	NoArgument	He never marries or has children .
264	NoArgument	Kant , Immanuel ( 1981 ) , Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals .
265	NoArgument	What is most striking about CC is not simply her mere existence , but also that CC does not look nor act like her feline progenitor , Rainbow .
266	Argument_against	In the “ Instruction on Respect for Human Life in Its Origin and on the Dignity of Procreation , ” the Catholic Church denounces all forms of reproductive technology on the grounds that reproductive creation is strictly God ’s domain ( Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , 1987 ) .
267	Argument_for	Using cloning technologies , genetic researchers would have a better understanding of the composition of genes and the effects of genetic constituents on human traits .
268	NoArgument	The men would only require a surrogate to carry the clone until birth .
269	NoArgument	At age 21 he inherits a 10 million dollar trust fund .
270	Argument_for	This will diminish the waiting list for organ donations and allow more people to be saved .
271	Argument_for	At age 40 after hearing about Dolly being a clone , he changes his will and has his DNA stored for future human cloning .
272	Argument_against	Will cloning , thus , compromise a child ’s identity ?
273	NoArgument	Golombok , Susan et al. ( 1995 ) , “ Families Created by the New Reproductive Technologies : Quality of Parenting and Social and Emotional Development of the Children . ”
274	NoArgument	The term “ therapeutic cloning ” is , however , more widely used .
275	NoArgument	This will eliminate the need to do an incision in back of the scalp for donor hair and will literally give the patient MORE hair . "
276	NoArgument	However , inciting differentiated nuclei to behave as undifferentiated nuclei was thought to be impossible , since the conventional wisdom at the time was that once a cell was differentiated ( e.g. , once it became a cardiac cell , a liver cell , or a blood cell ) it could never reverse into an undifferentiated state .
277	Argument_against	Because all children deserve to have a life and a future that is completely open to them in terms of its prospects ( Feinberg , 1980 ) , and because being the product of cloning would necessarily deprive the resulting child of these prospects , cloning is seriously immoral .
278	Argument_against	The more “ artificial ” conception becomes , the more the resulting children will be seen as the possessions of the parents , rather than as persons in their own right .
279	NoArgument	Some questions that arise are : Why did these individuals regard the recreation of the same DNA to equate to the recreation of the same entity that had died ?
280	NoArgument	For this reason human cloning should be allowed .
281	NoArgument	Response 1 : Negative vs. positive right to procreate .
282	NoArgument	The result is that the genes behave in ways that may lead to a difference in appearance .
283	Argument_for	As you can see , I think each and every reason to ban human cloning was logically contradicted or challenged .
284	NoArgument	By cloning humans , it will be possible for potential parents to actually choose particular traits for their children .
285	Argument_against	Many individuals regard the human embryo as a person with moral rights , and so they consider its destruction to be morally impermissible .
286	NoArgument	Cloning is not to be equated with genetic modification or enhancement ( Wachbroit , 1997 ; Strong , 1998 ) .
287	Argument_for	A cure for baldness - From one of our readers : " But how about the possibility of using cloning technology to get more hair on a balding scalp .
288	Argument_against	In fact , over 90 % of human cloning attempts have been labeled as “ failure ” , which means that the human DNA is only put at risk during the process .
289	NoArgument	Worse , being infertile is often not considered a " real medical problem " and insurance companies and governments are not sympathetic .
290	NoArgument	Hence , limiting access to certain types of assisted reproductive technologies to an otherwise infertile couple would not necessarily infringe on their ( negative ) right to procreate ( Courtwright and Doron , 2007 ) .
291	Argument_for	When scientists wish to replicate a specific gene to facilitate more thorough study , molecular cloning is implemented in order to generate multiple copies of the DNA fragment of interest .
292	Argument_against	At least 95 % of mammalian cloning experiments have resulted in failures in the form of miscarriages , stillbirths , and life-threatening anomalies ; some experts believe no clones are fully healthy .
293	NoArgument	This will be true only if we allow it to be true .
294	NoArgument	Interestingly enough , however , a few minutes into the program , the narrator , speaking over a picture of two identical cows , says : “ But even if a clone person is created , that does n’t mean it would be an exact copy of the original . ”
295	Argument_against	Cloned children would unavoidably be raised " in the shadow " of their nuclear donor , in a way that would strongly tend to constrain individual psychological and social development .
296	Argument_against	Even attempting to perfect human reproductive cloning would entail a trial and error approach that would lead to the destruction of many embryos , and may produce severely disabled children before a healthy one is born .
297	NoArgument	Since religion often comes into play with regards to this controversial matter , there emerge very passionate opinions that are not necessarily based on facts , but rather emotional .
298	Argument_against	Along with the ability to clone desired traits , there could be the possibility of people deliberately reproducing undesired traits .
299	Argument_against	It can bring forth a reduced sense of individuality .
300	Argument_against	If a patient were to receive stem cell therapy in order to treat some affliction , her body may reject the stem cells for the same reason human bodies have a tendency to reject donated organs : the body tends to not recognize , and therefore reject , foreign cells .
301	NoArgument	Take an introduction to biology with an online class .
302	Argument_for	For couples who have unfortunately lost their children , should not they be given the chance to replace their loved ones with clones , if possible ?
303	NoArgument	A cloned child would be gestated in a different uterine environment .
304	NoArgument	It has seen a lot of failure .
305	NoArgument	Quoted in : BBC News .
306	Argument_for	The anti-cloners also seemed to feel that they had the ability to predict the timing and course of science advancement , which history has shown to be folly .
307	NoArgument	However , there is much evidence to counter this claim .
308	NoArgument	The three anti-cloners came across as people who would destroy hope .
309	NoArgument	Our talents and desires are genetic , developmental , and environmental .
310	NoArgument	In 1928 , Spemann successfully cloned a salamander using nuclear transfer .
311	Argument_for	The technology can potentially help cure certain disorders , by replacing damaged tissues and organs within the human body .
312	Argument_for	Cloning human body parts guarantees a genetic match to prevent organ rejections and also does not require immunosuppressive drugs .
313	NoArgument	Additionally , she suffered from arthritis .
314	Argument_against	Sexual Orientation : Some people want to ban human cloning because they believe this is the only method that homosexuals can have children that will most likely be homosexual too .
315	NoArgument	Let us take a look at the pros and cons of cloning humans to come up with a well-informed decision on our end .
316	Argument_against	Rev. Stanley Harakas puts this point as follows : “ Cloning would deliberately deny by design the cloned human being a set of loving and caring parents .
317	NoArgument	I have only harmed an individual if I had made her worse off than she otherwise would have been had it not been for my actions .
318	Argument_for	Restrictions on research cloning could postpone therapies beneficial to millions of people .
319	NoArgument	Yet these parents are not prohibited from procreating because of this .
320	Argument_against	It interferes with nature .
321	NoArgument	Whatever these opinions are based upon , religion is definitely a motivating factor that keeps many people from agreeing with such a technology .
322	Argument_against	If cloning could be perfected and used for this limited group , it would be all but impossible to prevent its use from spreading .
323	Argument_against	It was for this reason that , for a long time , creating a cloned embryo from adult somatic cells was thought to be impossible – it would require taking long-time differentiated cells and getting them to behave like the totipotent cells ( cells that are able to differentiate into any cell type , including the ability to form an entirely distinct organism ) found in newly fertilized eggs .
324	Argument_against	The Center for Genetics and Society believes that when all the arguments are considered together the case for allowing human cloning is not compelling , and that the harms of doing so are great .
325	NoArgument	First , doubts can be cast as to whether this confusion would really ensue .
326	NoArgument	Medical tragedies - Many people have suffered accidental medical tragedies during their lifetimes .
327	NoArgument	In this process , the specific DNA fragment is transferred from one organism into a self-replicating genetic element , e.g. , a bacterial plasmid ( Allison , 2007 ) .
328	Argument_for	Living on through a later-born twin - Some childless people feel that by being cloned by their later-born twin would help them or their DNA to live on in the same sense that people who have children live on .
329	NoArgument	Are such concerns grave enough to permanently ban reproductive cloning altogether ?
330	Argument_against	Women 's health advocates are concerned about the health and social justice implications of creating a market for human eggs in which most donors are likely to be poor women .
331	Argument_for	People question their right to bring a child that technically is n't related to them into a lifestyle that falls below societies views of normal ..... human cloning could allow two gay men to take 23 chromosomes from each male and put them into a single egg to truly have a baby of their own .
332	Argument_against	95 % of animal cloning has ended in failure due to genetic defects , and cloning is considered unsafe because of it .
333	Argument_against	Indeed , safety concerns led the National Bioethics Advisory Commission ( 1997 ) to recommend a temporary , rather than permanent , moratorium on human reproductive cloning .
334	Argument_against	These boundaries are set by either God ( and therefore cloning is wrong because it is “ playing God ” ) or nature ( and therefore cloning is wrong because it is “ unnatural ” ) .
335	NoArgument	This means that sex , eye color and other characteristics can be selected and not left up to chance .
336	Argument_for	No longer would there be the worry of scientists harming creatures because these creatures would be cloned specifically for the purpose of research .
337	NoArgument	Another response is that Kant ’s dictum is misapplied .
338	NoArgument	Response 2 : Forgetting nurture .
339	NoArgument	His DNA clone will inherit a trust fund .
340	NoArgument	Tooley , Michael ( 1998 ) , “ The Moral Status of Cloning Humans ” in Human Cloning : Biomedical Ethical Review .
341	Argument_for	However , not everyone is physically capable of procreating through traditional modes of conception .
342	Argument_against	The prospect of creating a child , solely to meet the needs of another child and not for her own sake , reduces the created child to a mere means to achieve the ends of the parents and the sick child .
343	Argument_for	However , it is only because of the possible medical advances and the possible advantages to the human race that human cloning should be allowed .
344	NoArgument	Women are made to feel as if they are useless barren vessels .
345	NoArgument	Whereas Rainbow , a calico , is stocky and has patches of tan , orange , and white throughout her body , CC barely resembles a calico at all .
346	NoArgument	A positive right requires more from obligation-bearers ; it requires that active steps be taken in order to provide the right-bearers with the means to fulfill that right .
347	NoArgument	More than one person has written the Human Cloning Foundation ( including a twin that feels close to her identical twin ) that since a clone is virtually the equivalent of an identical twin , they suspect a very special relationship would exist between a clone and its DNA parent .
348	Argument_against	Therapeutic cloning is controversial because isolating the stem cells from the embryo destroys it .
349	Argument_for	Economics - Countries that fail to research human cloning will suffer economically .
350	NoArgument	Because so many people want cloning - Please read the dozens of essays by people from all over the world in support of human cloning and published by the Human Cloning Foundation .
351	Argument_against	The child would be destined to live in the shadows of her genetic predecessor ( Holm , 1998 ) .
352	NoArgument	The previous year ’s work , which led to the birth and survival of Megan and Morag , used more than 200 embryos .
353	NoArgument	From the time that an ovum is fertilized and syngamy ( the fusion of two gametes to form a new and distinct genetic code ) has successfully taken place , there exists a subject , the embryo , which is a bearer of dignity , moral status , and moral rights .
354	NoArgument	Even if a cloned child did display certain behavioral traits belonging to her genetic predecessor , it is unclear whether the similarity in traits entails that a child ’s future would be closed off .
355	Argument_against	This conditional respect may support the permissibility of prohibiting human cloning for reproductive purposes .
356	Argument_against	Sub-Human : Imagine a new race of people that are docile with super strength yet low intelligence .
357	NoArgument	They reminded me of the same types of people who proclaimed that cloning was impossible years ago .
358	NoArgument	Even if there were such confusion , however , would it be so detrimental as to warrant banning reproductive cloning altogether ?
359	NoArgument	Steinbock , Bonnie and Ron McClamrock , ( 1994 ) “ When Is Birth Unfair to the Child ? ”
360	NoArgument	Some are either discarded or frozen for future use .
361	NoArgument	However , since key religious texts ( e.g. , The Bible , The Torah , or the Qu ’ ran ) make no mention of such advancements , it is presumably impossible to determine what God would have to say about them .
362	Argument_against	Moreover , because the embryos are created with the explicit intention to destroy them , there are concerns that this treats the embryos in a purely instrumental manner ( Annas et al. , , 1996 ) .
363	NoArgument	Like many of the arguments against reproductive cloning listed below , this argument in favor of cloning , despite its emotional appeal , erroneously assumes that genetic determinism is true .
364	Argument_against	The cloned human being would not be the product of love , but of scientific procedures .
365	Argument_against	You can leave skin cells even on a computer keyboard , and those cells could be used to clone you if cloning becomes a reality .
366	Argument_for	Research cloning will be necessary in order to produce compatible tissues and organs for patients being treated with stem cell therapies .
367	Argument_against	Although he rejects the contention that clones would not be considered persons , Thomas Shannon expresses concerns that the increasing artificiality of conception , not just via the use of cloning , but via the use of all forms of artificial reproductive technologies , will “ transform our thinking about ourselves , and the transformation will be in a mechanistic direction ” ( Shannon and Walter , 2003 , 134 ) .
368	NoArgument	As humans continually reproduce , damage to their DNA lines increases .
369	NoArgument	Religion : I believe it is impossible for anyone to know the true intentions of God if God exists .
370	NoArgument	It explores some classic stereotypes of human clones , and it illustrates how many of these stereotypes can be traced back to media portrayals about human cloning .
371	Argument_for	Dr. Richard Seed , one of cloning 's leading proponents , hopes that cloning will help us understand how to reverse DNA back to age 20 or whatever age we want to be .
372	Argument_against	The technology of cloning humans is already here , as evidenced by Dolly the sheep , but it called forth questions about the role of God in society , the soul and even the quality of life a cloned individual would have .
373	Argument_against	Without a system of strict public oversight and control , some of the clonal embryos created in laboratories are likely to wind up being used for reproductive purposes .
374	Argument_against	There is also the belief that these clones would be created without a soul .
375	Argument_for	Cloning would be a step towards a fountain of youth .
376	NoArgument	Response 1 : Assuming genetic determinism .
377	NoArgument	Some people believe in one religion and others in another .
378	Argument_against	Super Humans : Selecting the most perfect genetic donor in someoneï ¿ ½ s opinion , whether it is Albert Einstein , Michael Jordan , or some other above average person , changes the norms of society .
379	Argument_for	Though treatments for infertility these days are somehow successful , cloning can reached even greater heights , like being able to take cloned cells to create a younger twin of a father or a mother .
380	NoArgument	If the child is cloned with the intent to serve as the social child of her genetic predecessor , she would be , genetically , her social mother ’s twin sister ( or his social father ’s twin brother ) , and her social grandparents ’ genetic daughter .
381	Argument_against	It might decrease the overall value of human life .
382	Argument_for	Many scientists hope that , with proper research and application , embryonic stem cells can be used to treat a wide variety of afflictions , e.g. , tissue toxicity resulting from cancer therapy ( National Cancer Institute , 1999 ) Alzheimer ’s disease ( Gearhart , 1998 ) , Parkinson ’s disease ( Freed et al , 1999 ; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Strokes , 1999 ; Wager et al. 1999 ; Gearhart , 1998 ) , diabetes ( Voltarelli et al , 2007 ; Shapiro et al. , 2000 ) , heart disease ( Lumelsky , 2001 ; Zulewski , 2001 ) , and limb paralysis ( Kay and Henderson , 2001 ) .
383	Argument_against	Rather than being considered persons , the likelihood is that these cloned human beings would be considered ‘ objects ’ to be used ” ( 1998 , 89 ) .
384	NoArgument	According to Wilmut , “ Dolly was derived from 277 embryos , so the other 276 did n’t make it .
385	NoArgument	In 1951 , Robert Briggs and Thomas Kling , using Spemann ’s methods of embryonic nucleus transfer , successfully cloned frogs .
386	Argument_against	There are concerns that cloned humans would lack individuality , that they would be treated in undignified ways by their creators , or that they would be damaged by society ’s expectations that they should be more like those from whom they were cloned .
387	Argument_against	Reproductive cloning would foster an understanding of children , and of people in general , as objects that can be designed and manufactured to possess specific characteristics .
388	NoArgument	We can pass strong laws making reproductive cloning illegal without banning research cloning .
389	NoArgument	The two lines of research go hand in hand and should complement each other .
390	Argument_against	Dan Brock further supports the contention that cloning in order to replace a deceased child is misguided ( Brock , 1997 ) .
391	Argument_against	The claim is that a cloned child would be in danger of suffering from severe genetic defects as a result of being a clone , or that cloning would result in a high number of severely defective embryos before one healthy human embryo is developed .
392	NoArgument	A summary comment follows at the end of the arguments .
393	Argument_against	When parents do not like the children they have got , then they would just go clone another one in the hopes of getting it perfect the next time around .
394	Argument_against	Moreover , because parents have cloned this child with the expressed purpose of replacing a deceased child , the expectations that the new child will be just like the deceased one would be overwhelming and impede the child ’s ability to develop her own individuality ( Levick , 2004 ) .
395	NoArgument	Yet , if I were to wait two months , my ailment would pass and I would conceive a perfectly healthy baby .
396	NoArgument	Edited by Michael C. Brannigan .
397	Argument_for	Because this kind of cloning does not result in the genesis of a human organism , it has no reproductive intent or goals , and it does not result in the creation and destruction of embryos , there is little to no contention regarding its use .
398	NoArgument	If a person were to believe that genetic determinism is true , then it follows that she believes that a cloned person would be psychologically identical with her genetic predecessor because they are ( almost ) genetically identical .
399	Argument_for	Cloning is a reproductive right , and should be allowed once it is judged to be no less safe than natural reproduction .
400	Argument_for	It may also be possible to use therapeutic cloning to repair defective genes by homologous recombination ( Doetschman et al. , 1987 ) .
401	NoArgument	It is just a completely wrong idea for the many .
402	Argument_for	Cloning humans is an innovative method that is an extremely powerful tool to bring about a huge change for the entire world .
403	Argument_for	Cloned embryos are said to be needed for research on embryonic stem cells that promise to revolutionize medicine .
404	NoArgument	: It Depends on Your Religion . ”
405	NoArgument	Coming to an agreement on this hot subject is not easy , but understanding it deeply can lead to some level of clarity .
406	Argument_against	Perfection of techniques to create clonal human embryos would make it more difficult to prevent the births of human clones .
407	Argument_for	In other words , the Wolfs ( and the woman who cloned Nicky ) were willing to spend an exorbitant amount of money to clone their pets not just in order to receive another pet , but to , rather , receive what was , in their eyes , the same pet that they had lost ( Masterson , 2010 ) .
408	NoArgument	Response 1 : No such confusion is likely to arise .
409	Argument_against	Would there be any defense against people collecting cells and cloning random people ?
410	NoArgument	This objection appears to be an incarnation of the objection from the Right to an Open Future .
411	NoArgument	Will these expectations transfer over to human cloning , where people will regard cloned children as the same individuals as their genetic predecessors , and therefore treat them with this expectation in mind ?
412	NoArgument	Thomas Murray continues his article by disclosing that he too is a grieving father , having suffered the death of his twenty-year-old daughter who was abducted from her college campus and shot .
413	Argument_against	Many people feel strongly the cloning humans is completely wrong , with the state of the technology at the moment possibly involving a huge number of damaged pregnancies to achieve a single live baby clone .
414	Argument_for	Your body would recognize the new organ as your own .
415	NoArgument	The embryos are then transferred into a womb and , upon successful implantation and gestation , are born as identical multiples .
416	Argument_against	Cloning a child to be a reincarnation of someone else is a grotesque , fun-house mirror distortion of parental expectations ” ( 2001 ) .
417	NoArgument	Kitcher , Phillip ( 1997 ) , “ Who ’s Self is it Anyway ? ”
418	Argument_against	According to some ethicists who oppose human cloning , a cloned child ’s identity and individuality will be compromised given that she will be “ saddled with a genotype that has already lived ” ( Kass , 1998 , 56 ; see also Annas , 1998 and Kitcher , 1997 ) .
419	Argument_against	In other words , even granting that individuals have a positive right to procreate , it does not follow from this alone that they should be provided with any means necessary for successful procreation .
420	NoArgument	In biology , the activity of cloning creates a copy of some biological entity such as a gene , a cell , or perhaps an entire organism .
421	NoArgument	Discover a mathematical way to observe biology with an online course .
422	Argument_against	Any treatments that rely upon cloning techniques would be very expensive , and likely unaffordable to large majorities of people .
423	NoArgument	The images and not-very-clever headlines all convey unsettling messages that clones will be exact copies , while inside the stories go to some effort to educate us that clones will not in fact be exact copies ” ( 1998 , 129-130 ) .
424	Argument_for	There is also the likely ability to alter genetic constituents in cloned humans , and cloning could help combat genetic diseases .
425	Argument_for	Perfection of cloning techniques would open the door to even more powerful technologies of human genetic modification .
426	NoArgument	Gurdon ’s successful use of differentiated nuclei , rather than the embryonic nuclei used by Briggs and Kling , was particularly surprising to the scientific community .
427	Argument_against	Even a Discovery Channel program , meant to educate its viewers on the nature of cloning , initially portrays a clone as nothing more than a duplicate of the original person .
428	Argument_against	Reproductive cloning would diminish the sense of uniqueness of an individual .
429	NoArgument	If harm is defined as making someone worse off than she otherwise would have been , it is difficult to maintain that I harmed the resulting child by my actions , even if she were impaired .
430	Argument_for	Not only that plants and animals can be revived with cloning , but also humans can be cloned to offer potential benefits to other people who are living .
431	Argument_against	The technique could not be developed in humans without putting the physical safety of the clones and the women who bear them at grave risk .
432	NoArgument	You want your clone to lead the life that was meant to be yours - The Human Cloning Foundation has been surprised by the number of people that write to say that they would like to have a clone so that it may lead the life that was meant to be theirs .
433	Argument_against	Arguments against cloning appeal to concerns about a clone ’s lack of genetic uniqueness and what may be implied because of this .
434	Argument_for	Endangered species could be saved - Through the research leading up to human cloning we will perfect the technology to clone animals , and thus we could forever preserve endangered species , including human beings .
435	Argument_against	No child should have to bear the oppressive expectation that he or she will live out the life denied to his or her idealized genetic avatar … .
436	NoArgument	Response 2 : Assuming genetic determinism ( again ) .
437	Argument_against	Though it might seem like a scenario straight from a sci-fi film that people might use clones for unlawful interests and crime , it is still possible if human cloning takes a common place in society .
438	Argument_against	Expectations : Expectations of cloned humans to be identical to the genetic original person would undoubtedly cause a lot of psychological pressure , especially while growing up .
439	Argument_against	Scientists believe this lack of diversity will lower the human race ’s ability to adapt .
440	Argument_against	Perhaps the more charitable understanding is that “ playing God ” is morally wrong when it comes to cloning because it is a process that artificially creates life , outside of the practice of sexual intercourse ( Meilaender , 1997 ) .
441	Argument_for	Animals and plants could be cloned for medical purposes - Through the research leading up to human cloning , we should discover how to clone animals and plants to produce life-saving medications .
442	NoArgument	One interesting point is that both detractors of cloning ( e.g. , Kass and Callahan , whose views are explored below ) and supporters of cloning ( like the researcher that read this letter at the congressional hearing ) find convergence in committing the same fallacy .
443	Argument_for	Using the person ’s own cells , they will be able to recover that much faster and that much easier .
444	Argument_for	As long women give informed consent and are fairly compensated , markets in human eggs should not be seen as a bad thing .
445	NoArgument	Applied to preconception choices , Parfit ’s argument can be applied as follows .
446	Argument_against	They may not be entitled to the use of a certain technological advancement ( e.g. , SCNT ) if that advancement is deemed to pose a danger to the resulting offspring .
447	Argument_for	Scientists believe that embryonic stem cell research will lead to cures for many diseases and will provide tissues and organs for transplant and treatment of degenerative conditions .
448	Argument_for	To be a better parent - Human cloning can improve the parent-child relationship .
449	Argument_against	Because of the expectations that the cloned child will re-live the life of her genetic predecessor , the child would necessarily be deprived of her right to an open future .
450	Argument_against	Large scale research cloning could generate a market for women 's eggs that could easily lead to exploitation .
451	NoArgument	A negative right to x means that no one has the prima facie right to interfere in your request to fulfill x .
452	Argument_against	Typically , those who offer the second response ( e.g. , the Catholic Church ) regard the human embryo as a complete moral subject upon conception ( Pope John Paul II , 1995 ; Pope Paul VI , 1968 ) , and therefore any experiment that harms them or destroys them is morally tantamount to any experiment that would destroy a person .
453	Argument_against	According to this objection , our DNA is what endows each human being with uniqueness and dignity ( Callahan , 1993 ) .
454	Argument_for	It could be used to understand the genetic contribution to disease and to test vast arrays of new drugs which could not be tested in human people ” ( Savulescu , 2007 , 1-2 ) .
455	Argument_for	Theories exist about how cloning may lead to a cure for heart attacks , a revolution in cosmetic surgery , organs for organ transplantation , and predictions abound about how cloning technology will save thousands of lives .
456	Argument_for	And finally with further research , it could be possible to decrease the number of embryos created to only a single embryo .
457	Argument_against	The reasons for doing any action must out weigh the reasons for not doing the action , therefore cloning a person should not be because of capability .
458	NoArgument	One day in the not too far distant future , Japan may realize its mistake .
459	NoArgument	His future mother will be awarded one million dollars to have him and raise him .
460	NoArgument	It gives a new meaning to genetic modification .
461	Argument_for	Unlike therapeutic cloning , the cloned embryo is transferred into a uterus of a female of the same species and would be , upon successful implantation , allowed to gestate as a naturally fertilized egg would .
462	Argument_against	Yet cloning , Murray continues , “ can neither change the fact of death nor deflect the pain of grief ” ( 2001 ) .
463	NoArgument	What about replacing an aged body with a new body by transplanting the human brain ?
464	NoArgument	Levick , Stephen ( 2004 ) , Clone Being : Exploring the Psychological and Social Dimensions .
465	NoArgument	Finally , as is evident from children raised by adoptive parents , social parents usually retain the honorific role as the child ’s “ real ” parents , even though there are no genetic ties between them and the adopted child .
466	NoArgument	This intuitive response , however , is surprisingly tricky to defend .
467	NoArgument	Find out the pros and cons , and decide for yourself if cloning is worth the risks .
468	Argument_for	Indeed , it is precisely because of these ethical issues that some individuals object to the positive connotations of the term “ therapeutic ” and refer to this work , instead , as “ research cloning . ”
469	Argument_against	As such , there would be a lack of diversity in humankind .
470	Argument_for	One way to overcome stem cell rejection is by creating embryos through somatic cell nuclear transfer with the patient ’s own DNA .
471	NoArgument	No one claims that identical multiples ’ right to a unique genetic identity was compromised simply in virtue of their creation , which calls into question whether such a right exists in the first place ( Silver , 1998 ; Tooley , 1998 ; Rhodes , 1995 ) .
472	Argument_against	The predominate theme underlying arguments against human cloning is that the cloned child would undergo some sort of physical , social , mental , or emotional harm .
473	Argument_for	A Child 's right to be better than its parents - It 's been suggested that parents have a duty to see that their children have better lives than they do .
474	NoArgument	Read an interesting article on questions for the GCSE exam .
475	Argument_against	" Replacing " the deceased child by cloning degrades and dehumanizes the child , its replacement , and all of us .
476	NoArgument	Cohen , Cynthia ( 1996 ) , “’ Give Me Children or I ’ll Shall Die ! ’
477	Argument_against	If genes are modified to create beings who are smarter than others , the average person will not have a place in society .
478	Argument_for	Using their own cells , they would be given the chance to truly heal with less complications .
479	NoArgument	Response 1 : Faulting cloning for the misconceptions of others .
480	Argument_for	Just the research of human cloning alone could save a great many lives .
481	NoArgument	The article summarizes the different types of cloning , such as recombinant DNA/molecular cloning , therapeutic cloning , and reproductive cloning .
482	NoArgument	Because an older cell is often being used to create a human clone , there is the possibility that this imprinted age could be placed on the growing embryo .
483	NoArgument	While it will always unethical to kill another human being to save another person , what if the cloned human body replacement did not have a brain and was intentionally designed that way from the beginning ?
484	Argument_against	If a particular type of reproductive technology poses a health risk to the resulting children , this is grounds enough to prevent the use of that technology ( Cohen , 1996 ) .
485	Argument_for	Curing Diseases : The growing scientific field known as regenerative medicine , also known as therapeutic cloning , is allowing thousands of lives to be saved from cloning human cells , tissues , and even organs .
486	Argument_against	With human cloning on the rise , it is greatly possible that human beings would become more of a commodity than an individual .
487	Argument_for	But cloning technologies are needed if inheritable genetic modification is to become commercially practicable .
488	NoArgument	“ Are Scientists Playing God ?
489	Argument_for	Reproductive cloning could allow parents of a child who has died to seek redress for their loss .
490	NoArgument	This article discusses the biological , historical , and moral aspects of cloning mammals .
491	Argument_for	Third , embryos can also be used in stem cell research , and thus possibly save human lives .
492	NoArgument	Moreover , it is not just parents of cloned children that may be guilty of violating the child ’s right to an open future ; many parents are , to varying degrees of severity , already guilty of violating such a right with their naturally created children , and often times those attempts are subject to failure ( see Agar , 2004 , 106 for such an example ) .
493	Argument_for	To make a future couple financially secure - With human cloning you could give a couple in the future both a child from your DNA and the financial assets from your lifetime to start out financially secure instead of struggling as most couples do now .
494	NoArgument	Wilmut , Ian et al. ( 1997 ) , “ Viable Offspring Derived from Fetal and Adult Mammalian Cells . ”
495	NoArgument	At its core , however , this objection assumes the very controversial thesis that either a person ’s genes play an almost fatalistic role in her life decisions , or that individuals in society will assume some robust version of genetic determinism to be true and will treat cloned children according to that assumption .
496	Argument_against	Reproductive cloning is inherently unsafe .
497	Argument_for	Those who fail to begin research right away will fall behind .
498	NoArgument	Were they alcoholic , child-beating molesters ?
499	Argument_for	Moreover , those who have made significant contributions to science , the arts , music and literature would be ideally cloned to produce more of them to contribute more of their works .
500	NoArgument	This is only science fiction now , yet it may some day be a possibility in the distant future .
501	Argument_against	Many philosophers and ethicists who would otherwise support reproductive cloning concede that concern for the safety of children born via cloning is reason to caution against its use ( Harris , 2004 ; Glannon , 2005 ) .
502	NoArgument	In addition to somatic cell nuclear transfer , there is another , less controversial and less technologically complex , manner of reproductive cloning : artificial embryo twinning .
503	NoArgument	Voltarelli , Julio C. ( 2007 ) , “ Autologous Nonmyeloablative Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Newly Diagnosed Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus . ”
504	Argument_for	Cloning techniques will eventually be perfected in mammals and will then be suitable for human trials .
505	Argument_against	However , whereas in the objection from the Right to an Open Future , the cloned child is deprived of individuality based on the perception of others ( and , as is developed above , this does not seem to really be an objection to the practice of cloning simpliciter ) , this objection indicates that there is something inherently individuality-compromising , and therefore dignity-compromising , in recreating an existing genetic code .
506	NoArgument	However , it is unclear why generating a child via somatic cells is more likely to foster despotism than when the child is generated using germ cells .
507	NoArgument	Did you never have a chance ?
508	NoArgument	Advocates of the “ playing God ” objection have the onus to define exactly what “ playing God ” means .
509	Argument_against	Human Rights : A lot of people worry that cloned people would not have full rights , since they are just copies .
510	Argument_against	It might be used for exploitation .
511	Argument_against	The anti-cloners made the case for stem cell research while alleging that cloning itself would not result in any major scientific breakthroughs .
512	NoArgument	In other words , what defines a parent seems to have less to do with genetics and more to do with who performs the social role of mother and father ( Purdy , 2005 ) .
513	NoArgument	We have success rates of roughly one in a hundred or less ” ( Klotzko , 1998 , 134 ) .
514	NoArgument	All these people favor cloning and want the science to proceed .
515	NoArgument	Richard T. Hull ( ed . )
516	NoArgument	March 25 , 1999 , “ What Would You Hope to Achieve from Stem Cell Research ? ”
517	NoArgument	“ Genetic Savings and Clone ” was founded by Lou Hawthorne , who was seeking a means to clone his family ’s beloved dog Missy .
518	Argument_for	Procreative liberty is a right well established in Western political culture ( Dworkin , 1994 ) .
519	Argument_for	It could eliminate defective genes .
520	NoArgument	If you know a good reason why human cloning should be allowed please write it as an essay and submit it at our FORUM
521	Argument_against	Another way of explaining it is that creating a child solely for the purposes of providing life-saving aid for another child violates Immanuel Kant ’s second principle formulation of the categorical imperative .
522	NoArgument	Kant proscribes treating persons as a mere means , rather than as ends in themselves , maintaining that persons should “ act in such a way that [ humanity is treated ] always at the same time as an end and never simply as a means ” ( 1981 , 36 ) .
523	Argument_against	Callahan argues that there is something intrinsically identity-depriving , and therefore dignity-depriving , in duplicating a genetic code .
524	NoArgument	( 2000 ) , “ Islet Transplantation in Seven Patients with Type I Diabetes Mellitus Using a Glucocorticoid-Free Immunosuppressive Regimen . ”
525	NoArgument	One response is to distinguish between a positive right to procreate and a negative right to procreate ( Pearson , 2007 ) , and argue that reproductive liberty can be fully respected in the latter sense , and only conditionally respected in the former sense .
526	Argument_against	Another common concern is that cloning is morally wrong because it oversteps the boundaries of humans ’ role in scientific research and development .
527	Argument_for	While I believe that pre-determining the sex of a child is not applicable in modern society , I find no logically moral reasons why this should be banned .
528	NoArgument	Genetic illnesses are not a leading killer of people today , but they could be in the near future .
529	Argument_for	Embryonic stem cells appear less likely to stimulate rejection after transplantation than other cell types .
530	Argument_against	If society wishes to ban inheritable genetic modification it can and should do so .
531	NoArgument	Bad parents - Did your parents destroy your life ?
532	Argument_against	Tis would cause premature aging issues and potentially lead to premature death .
533	Argument_for	Parents that have lost a child can have that child returned to them with a clone .
534	NoArgument	For the child that would have been born two months later would not have been the same child that is born if I do not wait ; the impaired child would never have existed had I waited those two months .
535	Argument_for	Other recent research suggests that it may eventually be possible to achieve similar results by " reprogramming " some of the patient 's own cells .
536	NoArgument	Although Missy died before she was successfully cloned , Hawthorne banked her DNA in the hopes of ultimately succeeding in this endeavor .
537	NoArgument	Unfortunately , I have not seen or heard a holistic explanation of both sides with all the reasons for and against human cloning , so I am going to list all the reasons that Iï ¿ ½ ve found so far .
538	Argument_for	This reason is self defeating ; because as scientists learn more , cloning humans has the possibility of becoming safer than naturally developing embryos by replacing randomized risks and genetic defects .
539	Argument_against	Response 2 : A child is not replaceable .
540	NoArgument	Proposals for commercially practicable inheritable genetic modification ( " designer babies " ) call for the use of cloning techniques to create embryos using stem cell nuclei that have been previously genetically modified .
541	NoArgument	The predominate belief that fuels this conception is that genetic determinism is true , i.e. , that a person ’s genes are the sole determining factor of her behavior and physical appearance ; essentially , that a person ’s identity is solely determined by her genetic constitution .
542	Argument_for	One advantage to doing this is that the later born twin could serve as a blood or bone marrow donor for her older sibling should the need arise ; because they are genetically identical , the match would be guaranteed ( the converse could also hold , that is , the older individual could serve as a donor for the clone should the latter ever need it .
543	NoArgument	Furthermore , there has been quite a bit of legislation proposing to completely ban human cloning , and a large amount of legislation proposing to allow human cloning .
544	Argument_against	However , there is a possibility that the age of the donor could be imprinted on the growing embryo .
545	NoArgument	Hopkins also points out that , like the narrator in the Discovery Channel program , many media outlets “ engage in confusing , contradictory bits of double-talk ( or double-show ) .
546	NoArgument	Yet , given that we have evidence that the robust form of genetic determinism these arguments assume is false ( Resnik and Vorhaus , 2006 ; Elliot , 1998 ) , both detractors and supporters of cloning who rely on it produce faulty arguments .
547	Argument_against	Also , the implications of what happens when the process goes wrong are still not fully understood , which is not good and could lead to problems that we will not be able to handle .
548	Argument_for	You can read about many of the expected medical benefits in the essay " The Benefits of Human Cloning . "
549	Argument_for	When it comes to infertile couples , should not they be granted the opportunity to produce clones of themselves ?
550	NoArgument	( To our knowledge the type of reproduction described here has not yet been done , but someday it will probably be possible . )
551	Argument_for	Restricting any sort of medical research is unacceptable .
552	Argument_for	To cure infertility - Infertile people are discriminated against .
553	NoArgument	Using genetic alteration in plants and animals , researchers can replicate organisms needed for research .
554	Argument_against	The tacit implication here is that cloning is desirable because it somehow presents a way to cheat death .
555	Argument_against	Also , evidence suggests that clones often have built-in genetic defects and are unhealthy , which can lead to premature ageing and even death .
556	NoArgument	In 2005 , two endangered gray wolves were cloned in Korea ( Oh et al. , 2008 ) .
557	Argument_against	Embryos at Risk : The process of human cloning increases the risk of harm to embryos and thus to the cloned person throughout their life .
558	NoArgument	Deckers , Jan ( 2007 ) , “ Are Those Who Subscribe to the View that Early Embryos are Persons Irrational and Inconsistent ?
559	NoArgument	If you cloned yourself , the resulting child would be neither your son or daughter nor your twin brother or sister , but a new category of human being : your clone .
560	Argument_against	Any method of procreation that does not implement traditional modes of conception , i.e. , not involving the union of sperm and ova , is guilty of one ( or both ) of these infractions ( Goodman , 2008 ; Tierney , 2007 ) .
561	NoArgument	Body Replacements : One of the stranger reasons for cloning humans is for a complete body replacement .
562	NoArgument	For example , it is physically possible for a child to have as many as six distinct “ parents ” : three genetic parents ( the mitochondrial DNA donor , the somatic cell donor used to re-nucleate an enucleated ovum , and the sperm donor ) , one gestational parent , and two ( perhaps even more ) social parents .
563	NoArgument	However , the strongest evidence against this claim is the existence of identical multiples , who are , in essence , clones of nature ( Pence , 2004 ; Gould , 1997 ) .
564	NoArgument	It can cause a divide among people .
565	Argument_against	As older cells are often used to create human clones , it is possible that their imprinted age could be adopted by the growing embryos , which can then create some premature aging issues and , potentially , even premature death .
566	NoArgument	Courtwright , Andrew M. and Wechsler Doron ( 2007 ) , “ Is Restricting Access to Assisted Reproductive Technology an Infringement of Reproductive Rights ? ”
567	NoArgument	For example , a cloned entity ’s phenotype ( its appearance ) may look very different than that of its genetic predecessor because the embryo can undergo epigenetic reprogramming , where nongenetic ( i.e. , environmental ) causes influence genes to manifest themselves differently .
568	NoArgument	She would have different friends , attend different schools , play different games , watch different television shows , listen to different music .
569	Argument_against	As you can see , human DNA can be contaminated , and the chances of success are very rare .
570	NoArgument	Even if technology were created in which your memories and thoughts could be transmitted to the clone , your clone would still be a different person .
571	Argument_for	If human cloning is completely banned , then this type of research would be stopped and a lot of lives would be lost .
572	NoArgument	Both assume that cloning recreates identity , and they differ only as to the desirability of that consequence .
573	Argument_against	Therefore , deliberate conception , gestation , and birthing of a child with mental , physical , or developmental impairments does not , usually , harm the child ( unless the impairments are so bad that they make the child ’s life worse than not having existed at all ) .
574	Argument_against	It goes against religious ethics .
575	NoArgument	Nature via Nurture : Genes , Experience , and What Makes Us Human .
576	Argument_against	Even if cloning were safe , it would be impossible to allow reproductive cloning for lesbians or gay men without making it generally available to all .
577	Argument_against	That is , the move away from natural conception towards artificial conception will lead to humans collectively regarding themselves as more machine-like rather than as organic beings .
578	Argument_against	Certainly the concerns are similar : that a cloned child would be deprived of her own individual identity because of her genetic origins .
579	Argument_against	Though human clones would be a brand new set of life with unique preferences , a loss of individuality is still potential , as clones would be simply twins of someone else , regardless of the age of that other person might be .
580	NoArgument	There is no clear information on who will have control over who gets cloned , and firms are already making money from storing tissues from dead partners and children until the time when human cloning becomes widely available .
581	NoArgument	Basically , human cloning is the artificial process of making a genetic twin of a person .
582	NoArgument	The main area of concentration is the moral dimensions of reproductive cloning , specifically the use of cloning in order to procreate .
583	NoArgument	First , it is heavily debated if killing a human embryo that is only a few living cells is murdering a person .
584	Argument_against	Human clones have often been depicted in movies as nothing but carbon copies of their genetic predecessor with no minds of their own ( e.g. , Multiplicity and Star Wars : Attack of the Clones ) , as products of scientific experiments that have gone horribly wrong , resulting in deformed quasi-humans ( Alien Resurrection ) or murderous children ( Godsend ) , as persons created simply for spare parts for their respective genetic predecessor ( The Island ) , or as deliberate recreations of famous persons from the past who are expected to act just like their respective predecessor ( The Boys from Brazil ) .
585	NoArgument	That is , the obligation becomes an active one as well as a passive one : an obligation to not destroy my life and also to provide services that enable me to preserve my life .
586	Argument_for	Endangered animals can be cloned to save the species .
587	NoArgument	Cloning requires the use of women 's eggs , typically ten or more for each attempt .
588	NoArgument	Brannigan , Michael ( ed . )
589	NoArgument	After a brief history of the development of cloning technology , the article considers arguments for and against reproductive cloning .
590	NoArgument	The ovum is then artificially induced to begin dividing as if it had been naturally fertilized ( usually via the use of an electrical current ) .
591	Argument_for	As humans reproduce continually , there is also an increase in damage to their DNA lines , creating defective and mutated genes , which could be eliminated by cloning healthy human cells .
592	NoArgument	The second response applies not just to therapeutic cloning , but to any type of embryo experimentation .
593	Argument_for	Cloning may be the only way for an otherwise infertile couple to have a genetically related child .
594	NoArgument	Pence , Gregory ( 2008 ) , Classic Cases in Medical Ethics : Accounts of Cases That Have Shaped and Define Medical Ethics .
595	Argument_against	In their article “ Genetic Modification and Genetic Determinism , ” David Resnik and Daniel Vorhaus state that , when it comes to genetic modification , “ even if a desired trait is successfully expressed it may not actually restrict options for the child … the open future critique paints with a far broader brush , alleging that the act of modification per se impacts the child 's right to an open future .
596	Argument_against	There are many more arguments against reproductive cloning , but this is a brief list of the main arguments .
597	Argument_for	Same sex couples can have children without the use of donor sperm or donor eggs .
598	NoArgument	In America , some people believe gun control and some do n't .
599	NoArgument	For example : A boy graduates from high school at age 18 .
600	Argument_for	Alan and Kristine Wolf paid thousands of dollars to have their deceased cat , Spot , cloned from skin cells they had preserved .
601	Argument_against	Plus , there would be a lack of diversity in the world leading to everyone looking the same .
602	NoArgument	Hope - On the Charlie Rose television show on February 14th , 2001 , three anti-cloners debated against one reporter .
603	NoArgument	Even most of the reasons to allow human cloning were opposed too .
604	Argument_for	One possible use of reproductive cloning technology is to help save endangered species ( Lanza et al. , 2000 ) .
605	NoArgument	Additionally , I am going to address each of these issues on their rational merit .
606	NoArgument	In other words , Wilmut and Campbell were able to take a fully differentiated adult cell and revert it back to an undifferentiated , totipotent , state .
607	Argument_against	Because cloning recreates a pre-existing DNA sequence , the cloned child would be denied that uniqueness and , therefore , her dignity would be compromised .
608	Argument_against	It would violate deeply and widely held convictions concerning human individuality and freedom , and could lead to a devaluation of clones in comparison with non-clones .
