414	NoArgument	They paint scary pictures of society growing humans for spare body parts or as custom-designed children .
415	Argument_for	It is difficult to understand why the act of sexual intercourse that leads to sexual procreation is any more ‘ dignified ’ or respectable than a reasoned decision by an adult to have a child , that is assisted by modern science .
416	Argument_for	Finally , these kind of instrumentalist concerns assume that cloning would always be done for instrumentalist purposes , which may not be the case ( e.g. , individuals may simply wish to use cloning for the same reason people use IVF , for the purpose of having biologically related offspring ) .
417	NoArgument	Lol ... I will say that if we do clone a human and it acts the same as everyone else ( it will be like teaching a baby all over gain yes of course ) then it will prove that there is faulty in the Catholic and other religions .
