4048	0.6976666667	Actually microstamping and ballistic databases require a human to make an exact match based on what their eye sees on a blown up image, so if an officer wanted you arrested for something you didn't do, he wouldn't even need one of your cases, he could just blame you for any murder and say that the casings found at the scene matched the ones that came from your gun.

3151	0.6165	first of all let's tackle this erroneous statement: And no one is saying genes aren't affected by the environment, except you First we have this statement from the article I provided: The question arises whether such mutations (changes in genes or in higher-order genetic structures) are in any way dependent on the environment.

2699	0.8405	Sorry to hop in here...but what do you think about what this Ph.D. molecular biologist says: Independent Birth of Organisms http://www.mattox.com/genome/synopsis.html#immut The new theory also deviates from accepted evolution theories in its claim that the genome of every distinct organism is forever closed to evolutionary-scale changes.
3516	0.435	but it in all the evidence we have found nothing has contridicted, the progression to more complex life, the rate at which complexity increases or the phycial mechnisms aren't fully understood.
1610	0.9058	If you rape a child then you deserve more than anybody to be put down and eliminated forever.
2633	0.87425	If the flood was contained to a single geographic area then it is entirely possible that Noah was able to build an ark large enough to contain all the animals within that area.
3883	0.8266	First off i never insinuated that was my phrase,only that i agree with it.Second of all,if you think Britain is so much better than the USA then please leave the USA,the quicker the better.And if all you anti gun people would be so kind as to send me your addresses i will send you all some cheese to go with your wine.Simple fact is nobody is going to take my guns from me unless i commit a serious crime,and im not alone in that feeling.So all your statistics and numbers arent going to change my feelings.
3257	0.52675	First, the verb "believe" is not within the lexicon of science.
5250	0.14	So now you are calling yourself extreme?
4152	0.6658	if you are male, 17 to 45 years old, you are the militia.
665	0.5945	The fact that you are unqualified to do a job because of your chosen religious behavior makes no difference, as it would not for any other reason.
3038	0.5973333332999999	But the use of the word evolution in reference to Darwins theory became so common that by the 6th edition of Origin even Darwin used it.
4585	0.4525	First Amendment rights are poltical, artistic, and economic communication.
1017	0.4018	First of all the Dog and Goat cannot legally consent so that's bunk.

3085	0.66	If you want to discuss evolutionary biology then you have to let go of whatever you think words mean when you are smokin' and jokin' with your homies on the corner.
2767	0.7726666667000001	But since atheism claims all naturalism proves its concept, it really has a big advantage with science, doesnt it?
1207	0.3165714286	First you want to complain about the state supreme court, and now you want to complain about the state legislature.
2379	0.3815	So, I personally don't pay much heed in using financial issues in dealing with justice issues.
2813	0.8079999999999999	But marc - the proponents of ID are always at great pains to explain that this 'higher power' need not be god, and they are not trying to push religion.
1510	0.045	If you don't mind, could you just outline your paradigm please?
3313	0.48525	But you aren't arguing against the theory of evolution when you invent your own definitions (or accept them from your creationist master).
3317	0.5486666667	The work that is going on now about exactly how DNA triggers changes in organisms is very exciting and, like most scientific discoveries, surprising.
266	0.7201666667000001	But you are not denying those because of the religion, but because it is harmful to others and more importantly, potentially to you.
2807	0.6805	But you have challenged science with your beliefs.
2727	0.889	But in a detailed critique of Dembski's filter theory, published in the current issue of the magazine the Skeptical Inquirer, Dr. Taner Edis, a physicist at Truman State University in Kirksville, Mo., said that while Dembski's mathematics were impressive, his analysis was probably detecting only the complexity that evolution itself would normally produce."

3559	0.4075	First become acquainted with the theory.
3244	0.4803333333	BUT it is the scientific definition of species as put forward by you that would separate them... whether or not their inability to breed was based on preference or anatomy!
5324	0.047	Much like some are trying to do now.
1784	0.789	But it would be smarter to act in a wise way and not as a thug, because, yes, what goes around comes around.
1237	0.2971428571	Yes but by three-quarters of the people or state legislatures, not by a simple majority.

761	0.4986	If its OK to be gay, why is it that God created Adam and Eve?
2939	0.85725	But evolutionary theory doesn't claim that species arise in a single generation.

910	0.45875	But above, you argued that the DoI "gave us important insight", now when it doesn't fit your premise, you want to disregard it.
4258	0.6255	But it makes no sense to increase the risk multiplier, let someone get murdered, and then argue that the multiplier was not at fault, since the victim was obviously susceptible to murder anyway.

3905	0.7493333333	The government has no business knowing who has a gun.
3792	0.9158333332999999	But to hold that the Second Amendment limits the federal government to regulations concerning only weapons which can be classed as antiques or curiosities,-- almost any other might bear some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia unit of the present day,-- is in effect to hold that the limitation of the Second Amendment is absolute.

4063	0.7067142857	I was under the impression that "Castle Doctrine" laws in a number of States allow for deadly force against unarmed intruders.

4343	0.5893333332999999	First, the idea that you should be required to display a genuine "need" for ownership in the first place.

4835	0.3955	I think as far as most anti's are concerned, you assume they are harmless and go back to sleep.emoticonXConfused
267	0.7301666667	If so, there should be no marriage, no monogamous long-term partnerships, and more violent competition.
1104	0.3245	But nobody is forcing you to support anti-Catholic policies.
1935	0.7124	But surely you Lonewolf, someone who aspires to be a man of faith one day, knows that God teaches us not to act upon the guilty for the one who retaliates agaisnt the sinner will be even more punished for doing the Lord's work.
386	0.65025	If you'll look back, quite a few pro-gay posters mention kids frequently.
4672	0.364	but charlie, the truth is he couldn't 'bully' or 'intimidate' anyone with such vitriol and collectivist rantings unless they believed it themselves.
3575	0.392	But which "fact of natural selection" was that?
4447	0.5534	First, 9/11 had nothing to do with gun ownership.
4713	0.4835	So far, those free zones haven't done a lot of good.
1563	0.9576	If you are going to make murder illegal, your government would be most hypocritical to allow the death penalty.
2916	0.7355	But what you must understand is that to fight evolution is to fight science itself.
209	0.7473333333	If it walks like a marriage, talks like a marriage and looks like a marriage, there will be a man and a woman in it.
909	0.4595	I utterly and irrefutably agree with your view.
1289	0.26775	But to even marry a foreigner, it is not so easy.
4039	0.792	If guns are allowed at schools it should be the schools duty to teach the kids about the dos and donts with guns.
3137	0.63475	But creationism never changes.
1842	0.7622	So then why shouldnt the criminal who caused this also be made to suffer greatly as well, and since our judicial system is not going to do this, then somebody else should.
4405	0.5661666667	First off, 4 million anti-tank weapons is not much when put against 400 million people, so you have a lot of venerable areas.
3685	0.37466666670000004	But again, that requires a YEC to contradict their belief in the flood.
958	0.35775	Let's see how you did on book burning and suppression of ideas.
1793	0.78625	Some people opine that bartering a few innocent souls in the system is okay in the long-run, which I find to be a falsity and a wicked and depreciative statement to those innocents sitting on their proverbial deathbed.
2088	0.623	Genesis 9:6 "Whoever sheds the blood of man, BY MAN shall his blood be shed; for in the image of God has God made man."
331	0.691	Yes, but this is why I brought up the bible, because that would be an alternate reason that would not be caused by homosexual brains that could occur in cultures supportive of homosexuality.
2714	0.8995	So Miller says that ID is less worthy, scientifically, than even Young Earth Creationism!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3162	0.69225	But in the case of finches that have only diverged into separate populations in the last few thousand years on the basis of specialization in the food they eat, why is it surprising that they interbreed when mates of their own species are hard to find?
2513	0.111	But Jesus doesn't ask the woman to acknowledge him or even the act.
1774	0.7965	executions from 1976 to 1999: Texas = 248 executions  nearly one-third of all U.S. executions since 1976 Virginia = 82 Florida = 51 Missouri = 50 Oklahoma = 43 Louisiana = 26 South Carolina = 25 Arkansas = 24 Alabama = 23 Arizona = 22 North Carolina = 17 Delaware = 13 Illinois = 12 California = 9 Nevada = 9 Indiana = 8 and Utah = 6 "A shocking recent death penalty study of 4,578 cases in a twenty-three-year period (1973-1995) concluded that the courts found serious, reversible error in nearly 7 of every 10 capital sentence cases that were fully reviewed during the period.
3518	0.4325	..... WW you have some of the vast storehouse of relevant evidence all ya gotta do is go read it.
3024	0.6895	emoticonXAngel If evolution has any motivation, however small, of anti religion driving it, determinations of its scientific objectivity should go beyond any one special interest.
4373	0.556	But do you really believe that we need an end to gun control?
2333	0.5666666667	So, your solution of 'coddling' criminals simply doesn't work.
3070	0.6579999999999999	I think the weak deer theory was so idiotic that everyone was somewhat stunned.
2843	0.8713333333	So, anyway, to boil it all down to one question... "Where has evolution been observed?"
3897	0.7884285714	First off pulling out a firearm is illegal.
4112	0.6722	First of all, I do agree that the definition of assult weapons is a little strange, and it essentially boils down to the guns that look scary.
1366	0.0085	Please check the election results for yourself.
173	0.7170000000000001	So the fact that it is not legally recognized is the problem.
4417	0.5631666667	But we don't know what was going on in Trayvon Martin's mind.
4254	0.57125	Yes Brady, I agree that gun control has a very racist and shameful past in America.
2980	0.7346666667	Some fundy minister has told them that evolution is evil,becuse it is done to disprove God, and the victim believes that lie and runs with it, showing up here all indignant, determined to disprove the falsehoods that he/she has been told.
4696	0.45899999999999996	So everyone else has to somehow make sure they're not around some gun nut?
1952	0.70575	If he's killed many, many people and he's repenting... he's faking it.
2732	0.7913333333	If there is no pattern connecting the future to the present selection there is no pattern connecting production with selection.
2036	0.6565	In response to Americans request to please enlighten me, thistownwilleat said this: " You have heard it said, an eye for an eye, but I tell you RESIST THIS EVIL, and turn then the other cheek."
3159	0.555	So in effect you belief people observe evolution happening, and don't try to demonstrate 'how', somehow it is just observed happening?
3814	0.8741666667	firstly, gun law would have to go back to federal government because the states will never have identical gun laws otherwise (which is essential for equality purposes), then if you want to get rid of guns, you need to work in phases by slowly introducing more restrictions (like the ones we have in Aus) and carefully rewording the second amendment.
3434	0.49	If you say the meaning of the creation passage, its message isn't wrapped up in whether it took place historically, I'm right on board with you.
0	0.9671666667000001	But that is not really my point my real point is that if we let this happend it will ruin marriage in this country, marriage is a bond between a man and a women and if we let gays marry this country will be ruining that tradition thus making this country more secular then it all ready is.
2174	0.5660000000000001	Here is a verse from Genesis 9:6 "Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed; for in the image of God has God made man."
1356	0.2156666667	No, I don't.
4742	0.5216	So, cavemen had the right to be free from lodging soldiers?
2580	0.9426666667	Some individual pieces are missing - we don't yet have the links between Australopithecus (which most definitely are transitional between humans and non-human apes) and the common human/chimpanzee ancestor.
4267	0.54075	The Militia Act of 1792 required that a report of private weapons be made to the federal government.
396	0.6361666667	Just for arguments sake, Why does any community (or union) need governmental recognition to legitimize it?
4741	0.027999999999999997	So they have at least done a bit of good?
2721	0.8275	Some idiot felt genesis actually explained creation.
1812	0.7768	But for us, and human beings in our right minds, to kill another human being when we ourselves are in no mortal and immediate danger is sick.
2942	0.6916666667	But advocates of the `fixed kinds' theory are willing to concede microevolution: they accept that mutations in two separated populations -- constrained by the conservative tendencies of natural selection and genetic drift -- can lead to variations over time within each group.
3858	0.763	So you think it is wise that the individual citizens can own functional surface to air missiles, and/or nuclear weapons?
816	0.451	But according to this definition, a person who is extremely intelligent would be classified as abnormal.
1572	0.94275	Sometimes, the only way to deal with certain criminals is to end their life, simply because they don't deserve to live.
3694	0.2716666667	sorry, I know I got WAY off topic, but it was a rant that was needed and I think it gives some context to those who believe in creationism.
1800	0.7835	Concur with the anti-death penalty side there.
4260	0.6246666667	Why should they be allowed to be uneducated just because they don't want a CCW permit?
4049	0.6679999999999999	But you could also use the same logic to say that shall issue laws should not be passed until further research is done on the issue so that we can be more sure about these effects laws.
2669	0.935	if you take what genesis says at face value, then it is quite clear that each "day" is just as long as a regular day in our time (i.e., from sunset to following sunset, 24 hours).
4648	0.4832	So if a terrorist stands up and says "anybody moves and I'll punch you in the head...this is a hijacking", people will cower in fear?
3143	0.6333333333	So it seems to me the two of you, whilst both seemingly supporting evoltuionary theory are at logger-heads with regard to just how distinct each animal kind is.
3035	0.6356666667	If thats true, then any theory of evolution must somehow clearly address biological origins, or it is not really about evolution.
2692	0.815	Some species are in the process of forming while others are recently formed and still difficult to interpret.
3494	0.2963333333	but evolution itself doesn't lean towards either side.
3661	0.30366666670000003	Some theories are philosophical, and some are not.
554	0.6027142857	But you are talking about from the beginning of civilised mankind, once we moved into societies we moved away from what is natural.
1159	0.29275	So Ill just repeat it below and maybe you can see where I clearly stated the difference, and its a big difference.
1213	0.311	But the economic points didn't make sense.
2543	0.94	Something that happened thousands of years ago cannot be ovserved by science.
1325	0.248	It wouldn't offend anyone, because they agree with me.
2670	0.8555	But natural selection is a hypothetical mechanism that happens to have strong empirical support in many cases.
2728	0.8383333332999999	Somehow or other, I feel, you have been led to believe that creationists adopted that theory after having applauded Goulds admission of serious gaps in the fossil record.
700	0.5006666667	First you have the religious institution of marriage.
3651	0.16399999999999998	But I have seen other biologists take exception to this definition as too narrow and not encompassing all of evolution.
3548	0.4156666667	Yes, once a gene has been established that leads via an established pathway to a given trait, the deliberately or accidentally modifying some other gene so that it in fact duplicates the established gene would lead through the same established pathway to the same established trait.
3826	0.8816666667	But people like you, Tim, are constantly pushing for more and more laws that will restrict our rights, while at the same time doing nothing to lock up the likes of gang bangers, cop killers and armed home invaders.
1455	0.107	But that just shows what I know about wings.
4510	0.5318	But where were these angry people when the Republicans decided to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to fight a war because of WMDs that turned out to be imaginary?
2877	0.6990000000000001	But fossils aren't directly dated.
3835	0.87775	If guns were not so readily available in America there would be far less shootings.
866	0.4545	Sorry, but the only ones with the intolerance around here are the Christian groups that refuse to tolerate homosexuals like myself.
1644	0.871	both me and thistown have quoted Jesus to support our stance on the death penalty.
3673	0.2935	IMO, YEC is heretical as it cast the Christian God with traits of Satan.
3254	0.5489999999999999	But atheism requires natural science  to be intellectually fullfiled.
4342	0.54425	So not to worry, your OK if all decent people are armed.
1490	0.076	First of all - what is a gay lifestyle?
2509	0.1236666667	If you have a water pipe break, you shut off the water until it is fixed.
729	0.5429999999999999	If I have a vasectomy, am I divorced?
4610	0.4143333333	But you seem to think if the punishment was, say, a fine than it would be ok?
3479	0.34575	(1) Even if real scientists have an a priori bias, your mention of this constitutes a red herring because you have attempted to divert attention away from my point about creationists starting with the assumption that whatever text they profess to be sacred is literally true.
1936	0.7124	If unalienable rights cannot be taken, then how did their victims right to life get terminated?
4564	0.513	Firstly, what is 'militia'?
1110	0.3725714286	So should your retirement, healthcare, prescriptions, etc. emoticonXMad
4376	0.5781428571	It is psychologically interesting that the title should describe the private store of guns as a "stash", with all the baggage of secrecy and illegality that that particular word connotates.
4809	0.4052	This is an example to everyone else to OBEY authority.
1185	0.3406666667	I mentioned the uncleanliness of the anus.
2007	0.6709999999999999	If you have seen of my other posts, I pretty much wipe ass with the pages of the bible.
193	0.7741666667	First of all the role of government is to protect the minority and all the citizens rights.
1515	0.0045	But why would I want to?
578	0.5828	BUT if you met me in the street and didn't know my sexual preferences you would like me.
2123	0.6012	So Voice of teason, (here is where you run away from this thread), it's alright to kill someone if the courts allow it and deem it just, such as how they did with the death penalty, but it's not alright if the courts allow it and deem it just, such as how they did with the abortion?
1429	0.1405	But you HAVE used that in the past.
771	0.4355	but how does one knwo if his church is "right" or "wrong" in your eyes.
5322	0.0486666667	First of all, we have to take your word, or buy the report.
1846	0.7616	If all lifers-without-parole were in isolation, it would still not preclude guards from being killed by them.
131	0.8086666667	If we want to talk about the world the over 90% of the world doesn't recognize homosexuality.
178	0.7636666667	Yes, but you are missing the point gay marriage debate is not an argument for polygamy, bestiality, incest and so on.
4804	0.40825	First, very few people make their own barrels.
3105	0.706	If I recall, Peddler also claimed to have "studied" evolution extensively.
2907	0.6723333333	First of all its theoretically possible to construct evolving systems which use mechanisms other than random mutation and natural selection.
2951	0.6635	Traditional science education argues that the same mind-knowledge and the same mind-processes take place both in the school context and the context of working science, and that it is these which constitute science and these which are being taught.
4397	0.57075	We live in a constitutional democratic-republic with an executive and judicial branch.
4098	0.6921428570999999	If the right existed before the creation of the militia why would it be limited to weapons that are used by militia members?
2073	0.6323333333	If a woman got pregnant that way I would hope that she would carry the baby to birth but I would understand the circumstances that made her decision to teminate the pregnancy........ After all the baby in this situation did nothing wrong......
658	0.5591428571	Part of the problem with that is that "religion" CURRENTLY HAS RESPONSIBILITY in marriage.
1896	0.736	Calligirl, I don't even want to waste my time explaining most of this to you but here goes... (All the quotes are yours, and I've tried to keep them in the order you stated them.)
3833	0.8688333333	if there were no guns, there would be no armed intruders.
2221	0.5326	So are you saying that we are probably more sure about death penalty cases than we are about LWOP cases?
4173	0.6574285714	if the gun haters are going to use this scare tactic they should be able to produce one recorded incident of this happening.
342	0.6445	If you loved a person of a different race but were prevented from marrying by law, would you think that denied your right to the "pursuit of happiness"?
4431	0.5603333333	So perhaps in a way, you are correct here but it only goes to prove my point.
727	0.5275	If everyone in this world was christian, maybe your logic might make more sense.
4240	0.6321666667	If somebody gives me that damned "That's different, guns are meant for killing but cars are made for traveling" argument, I'm gonna send them to the demolition durby.
976	0.4314	But it does, both financially and principly.
2346	0.456	So should proven rapists have rights?
3439	0.8390000000000001	But my beliefs are based on what I have observed and what I know of science.
1928	0.7154	But the problem is with determining whether or not a person ACTUALLY is guilty.
3010	0.6646666667	First, for the time being we must discard Biston as a well-understood example of natural selection in action, although it is clearly a case of evolution.
4957	0.33825	dreaming up imaginary what if situations doesnt prove anything, youve got nothing
1299	0.256	Perhaps it is the manner in which you say it.
3456	0.39899999999999997	It's deeply ironic that you think we have to set science aside to learn about the 'real world' :) Of course it's obvious that there's a struggle for hearts and minds.
4941	0.3434	if would probably slow them down more than it does now.
660	0.618	What if "those they love" involve 2 or more people, and they can only marry one of them?
1790	0.7872	If you base this belief on your christian superstitions you must at the same time believe that one who is killed should turn the other cheek.
4306	0.6465	First off, there is no "certain number of guns" that makes you a gun dealer.
3210	0.5785	If we were crocodiles having the same conversation about evolution, undoubtably our own arrogance would come into play and we would ask why all species don't develop thick armor-plating on their backs or have vice-grips for jaws or powerful tails to move quickly through the water.
3437	0.5456666667	But I will point out now that Im pretty sure that two of the species do not interbreed and four of the species breed but do not produce fertile offspring.
2527	0.0	If I wanted to I could put a little effort into this and completely destroy you.
3893	0.792	So Japan that has an absolute total ban on handgun ownership actually has more than four times the handgun-related murder rate of Australia where handgun ownership is restricted but still legal?
2526	0.012	So the forgiveness didn't require the crucifixion?
3116	0.7676666667	So it is very difficult to get hard answers, based on evidence, about the evolution of language ability.
1085	0.3815	If you consider calling judicial activism what it is, then I guess I'm guilty.
3690	0.066	But.... but... WW wrote this!
1278	0.27225	But if I get a sympathetic judge to change the definition of Native American, I wouldn't need to be.
3550	0.467	If it stands, then it has to be a science.
1621	0.8945	So far, I am hearing "an eye for an eye" which is just that vengeance centered sense of justice that I am arguing against.
3487	0.3555	If these creatures are anything like birds in their behaviour, they probably didn't fight each other often.
3262	0.537	If I had a stake in the argument, I'd object to it being taught in science classes on the grounds that it's not science.
67	0.86125	So in Michigan people care that my spouse-to-be is the same sex as I am because it's illegal to give a marriage license to same sex couples in Michigan?
5060	0.2816666667	But I think you are willing to give it all up.Just a thought here they did that pretty much in the U.K. I hear some people adapt easily.
2450	0.27925	If true, where is the independent, objective study which removes all doubt in 21-32 cases?
2269	0.4933333333	So I admitted that I didn't quite know how to interpret Jesus quote on the Old Law, so now you admit that you don't quite understand it either, that you do (not viciously or even always purposefully) use Old Testament passages as the foundation of your argument and then ignore the rest because it somewhat hinders your case.
4323	0.5976666667	But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security."
820	0.5025	Firstly, biased abstraction is your tactic.
1226	0.30475	But I don't deny he has a right to do it.
3458	0.1425	There currently is not enough evidence to really determine the size of any of these, and some paleontologists believe that they are merely large examples of known dinosaurs like Brachiosaurus or Diplodocus.
4503	0.5343333333	So lets control the most widely used tool that is used to murder people, instead of hands and feet :)
2473	0.2425	But they refuse to recognise that pro DP'ers debate because of their kind hearts.
3164	0.6266666667	If you'll notice, any argument you offer up is met with typical intelligent design as if every possibility has been considered and found wanting on our side.
4794	0.3404	If there was a cheap andeffective way to do it I think it would be worth considering.
4589	0.5418333332999999	So let me get this straight- Anything that you have the freedom to do is your natural right?
3872	0.8085	First, yes I believe that a prohibition on the private ownership of guns would lead to an increase in our overall death tolls; it certainly didn't work as predicted in the UK, that's one of the reasons we left.
1143	0.3526666667	If you're a gun-rights advocate, then maybe you know where I'm coming from.
397	0.659	first off stop making argument's that make you dizzey if you try to read it.
3355	0.531	If atheist philosophy is science, then ID philosophy should be also.
4622	0.48675	But the textual analysis must go further than this, for no one can seriously claim that Madison is guilty of a typographical error.
5122	0.2395	But here is the rub.
1398	0.177	So obviously more than this is required.
1659	0.934	First off, the point of the death penalty is not to prevent future killings, it is there to give justice.
2220	0.5353333333	So that's the view of someone who lives by the words of Christ.
979	0.4545	But those views were NOT written into the constitution.
2331	0.43566666670000004	So literally it was death for a tooth, and not due to the Pharisee's manipulation of the law, but due to the fact that the followed it explicitly.
1298	0.32175	So redheads and atheists and Jews and Green Party members and those with an IQ of 122 or higher, are deviant by that definition.
2617	0.885	But I don't "believe" in evolutionary biology "by faith."
82	0.72	completely agree here, people are arguing for the sanctity of marriage as people go to Vegas and get married for less than 24 hours.
2518	0.07200000000000001	Sorry, I don't understand how this addresses the point about justice being individual specific.
4986	0.1725	High on hyperbole aren't you.
4603	0.55925	It would be a better use of their resources to shoot up schools, burn down orphanages, XXXX up pizza parlors, and poison water supplies.
4239	0.598	The ol' "let's have more shootouts between the bad guys and good guys" solution to crime and lots of unsubstantiated claims as usual.
2643	0.8693333333	Evolution isn't about stupid, random changes, but organisms adapting to environments via genetic variations.
423	0.67925	So why wouldn't one encourage monogomous marriages for gay men, or anyone else, including perhaps raising a child?
4663	0.47275	But when it gets in your way, you don't try to tear it down; you either ignore it or reinterpret it.

4382	0.5756666667	First you source a guy who thinks it is OK to "cook data" then your sourcing another guy who by his own website, if I estimate correctly from his own bio, is about 30 years old and has had nothing but temporary and part time job his whole life.

4459	0.45799999999999996	Firstly, clearly your definition of 'self defence' is different from mine - more like Archangels, where attack is the best form thereof.
1801	0.7826	So tell me, why do you consider it punishment to lock someone in a cage for the rest of their life (sometimes 60+ years), yet it is automatically revenge to execute them?
1628	0.8858	If the death penalty deters murder (as you claim) then why does Europe have a lower murder rate even though they've outlawed the death penalty?

3081	0.588	So it seems that your claim is that Acanthostega, an evolutionary side branch, had to have existed in what became Greenland before some unknown creature could have existed in what became Australia could have made tracks.
3466	0.37775	but thats hardly reason to invalidate evolution.
2334	0.4335	So, was Jesus in favor of the death penalty?
4703	0.4553333333	First, define exactly what you consider "sufficient regulation".

3028	0.6884	If a species adapts over thousands or millions of years to a particular environment, it is to be expected that it is fairly optimised for that environment, in some kind of relatively stable equilibrium, and any new mutations likely would have already been selected against, so it is only natural that over generations such mutations, if introduced, disappear.

4263	0.6234285714	So assuming that these rights are God-given, and you acknowledge that, then Americans, when in a position of power outside of their own country, should consider the rights of the Bill of Rights to apply to the local population too, shouldn't they?
4567	0.5123333333	Tim Lambert has the same problem as most of the other anti gunners experts.
2074	0.63175	Yeah but to be honest I can't imagine many people would want to die on the electric plus we don't even use it anymore we use lethal injection and to be honest because its punishment it's not about choice for what is better.
4052	0.7113333333	So it is perfectly legal to shoot someone whom you think might possibly attack you in the future with a gun...seems if anything it is far more like removing the guns from people who can't be trusted with them.

1301	0.255	First of all let me say I'm 100% atheist.

2573	0.9385	But not all mutations can be called "genetic defects" by any stretch of the imagination, and no one proposes that a mutation is a step to a radical new organism.
3280	0.22899999999999998	so why even mention what you think are the horrible actions of evil atheists and their evil interpretations of evolution.
3186	0.618	If anything I had said that the Catholic Church has said that evolution is compatable with a belief in god.
3953	0.7568333333	So you seem to be saying that only laws will be obeyed by law abiding citizens (which everyone here agrees on), so why should we have any laws anyway?
2768	0.784	First, it is a common error (especially among the "sociobiologists") that all traits are the direct product of evolution, and that these traits must serve an immediate purpose.
4223	0.8915	ALSO IMPORTANT The court said: "In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a 'shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length' at this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument."

3190	0.56625	If you think it's a positive test, you need to read it again more carefully - or better yet read one of the comprehensive debunkings of Dembski's work.
5042	0.2805	But that may trigger a test case of the "may issue" CCW practice in the urban CA counties.
3594	0.19699999999999998	So it would seem that if there is a scientific theory of abiogenesis, it has been tested by definition and therefore isn't ad hoc.
1920	0.7190000000000001	But the vast majority are executed by lethal injections.

2198	0.5529999999999999	Vengeance is exactly the right word.

4864	0.141	So are you saying you do not think an airline passenger being flown into a building will kill you?
4990	0.3202	So how is something that is a myth available to law enforcement?
3300	0.525	But again from that web-site "** According to those who believe in alternative theories, this chain merely does not exist : it is impossible to consider the simultaneous evolution of each component of the eye, always respecting a growing evolutive advantage.

54	0.846	First of all, there is absolutely no reason to suggest that same-sex parents would make worse parents than opposite-sex parents.
4064	0.706	But there are also certain people who would use this right to hurt people.
3451	0.4792	If they don't see it yet, they will eventually see it as scientific proclamations such as "there was no Genesis flood", or "man and ape share a common ancestor" creep into the "established theory" classification.
1901	0.732	I know this is a very touchy issue, and I'll try not to state my opinions too bluntly, but how does death help anything at all?
1481	0.086	So with that information which you can look up for yourself if you dont believe me, I will ask the question again.
4150	0.6113333333	So the only source of food is hunting wild animals (and perhaps other people?)
3335	0.541	So a theory is a body of knowledge that explains phenomena.

388	0.6354	First off, you're wrong about God "making people gay," because it just is flat-out false.
235	0.8376	So, are you saying that it's forgivable for Christians to allow their marriages to dissolve away yet not ok for gays to even be allowed to try?
1077	0.389	But isn't that a contradiction to your volitional utopia ideal?

4837	0.3953333333	First off, what historical context have you found to prove that?
4912	0.3522	If someone can answer this for me, I will attempt the definitive assault weapon response.
1145	0.3522	Easy do you REALLY think I give two shits about your pathetic beliefs in the spiritual?
4468	0.5944	So do nothing, and the terrorists will just go away.
667	0.5573333333	It's like accusing someone in a blanket way that they don't think women's rights is important just because they disagree on the issue of DEGREE where choice should be a factor in the abortion debate.
3019	0.6146666667	To me it seems the fact that I constantly use terms like novel system and unique function, while evolutionist always use terms like evolutionary change and adaptation is somewhat like an ongoing strawman or attempt at equivocation.
357	0.669	If we truly inseparable from our genetic make-up then explain how a homosexual gene is genetically transferred from two heterosexual parents.
2831	0.8759999999999999	So the naturalists are using the ToE to get governmental powers expanded, and to take power away from the people?
2783	0.77475	If you think DNA identity is pure speculation you must deny that one can actually distinguish species much less different people via DNA.
1353	0.21925	If you dare to think for yourself, you will burn in hell forever!
470	0.629	So in the eyes of a value system that believes that something is valued higher that creates more offspring or "life", heterosexuality would be superior.
2703	0.8316666667	So Great Danes and Chihuahuas are different species after all and we know for a fact that they are descended from a common ancestor.
3330	0.47225	First up, it's not a valid question: evolution has nothing to do with binary systems (but being an evolutionary expert, you knew that already and were just testing me, eh?)
3637	0.1443333333	So now we get down to it, our "Hitlerian" quote by Darwin was not quite so explosive.
1396	0.22525	So is casual sex and rabies.
3584	0.49066666670000003	So if genesis can't explain some things then it is false?
4825	0.40075	So again you feel compelled to argue the methods not the points... The footnotes lead you to the raw data which if you were not intellectually lazy you could look up and argue the points of my posts.... but alas you won't you will simply continue to attack me....
3376	0.4625	So here is one large population that has become two different species at the extremes of its range, and those extremes overlap.
1256	0.5660000000000001	I agree with you on that.
3512	0.5795	So matching any creation theory to genesis is impossible.
1250	0.287	First, that this is their religion.
5165	0.213	Not only free but your courts deemed that Tony Martin Made the "environment hazardous to the burgular trade" Tony Martin who has NEVER been charged with a crime is serving how many years?
4298	0.47925	If they hate guns, then they want to take rights away from guns, not from people.
3284	0.4213333333	So geology is a religion because we weren't here to see rock X formed?
2933	0.6579999999999999	If you cannot find a way to bring along the lung of theropoda into full avian development, I will accept the admission of evolutionists that there are indeed no transitional fossils upon which to base their theories.
4175	0.7663333333	so you are all for ignoring all the people killed by cars, cigarettes, knives, AIDS, heavy objects, falling accidents, construction accidents, pneumonia, fires, and heart diesease.
1852	0.7593333333	If there ever was a deterrent to crime I'd hope being in genpop would be it.
5029	0.3013333333	If you need help with a concept this simple... emoticonXWow
5230	0.1626666667	First of all, that is badly out of context.
2105	0.5955	Society sets punishment, not victims.
133	0.79	So if the one study is correct that the average gay relationship lasts say 2 years, then we can validly conclude that while heteros currently have their share of problems, they are, on average, much more stable than homosexual relationships.
928	0.45675	So that blows your theory on God supposedly favoring what Solomon was doing.
823	0.501	First of all, quote where I "ever" referred to homosexuals as inferior in any way to anyone else?
4884	0.3718	But that doesn't make it grounds for removing them.
1531	0.0125	But is that claim really true?
1214	0.3105	First you say "Actually, I think it's probably the most compelling argument I've read for the amendment."
504	0.6205	Actually, I HAVE heard that phrase from a variety of different people on different boards.
4285	0.5986	If your serious about stopping availibility of guns to criminals, then these people should go into the slammer for a long long long time.
1996	0.6765	So, nature is no excuse for murder.
3072	0.606	So biology didn't exist before the theory of evolution was formulated?
1958	0.7002	IF YOU THINK THEM DOING THEIR TIME HAS PAID FOR THE CRIME , THEN I THINK THAT YOU DONT THINK MUCH AT ALL.
1384	0.19166666670000002	First, in order to be fair, let's post my whole passage as quoting just the part you did changes the meaning of what i actually said.
894	0.31475	So you actually remember when you made the choice to become hetrosexual?
455	0.6406	But that is who I want to marry.........You want to marry your boyfriend.what is the difference?
4981	0.3862	But at the same time pack large rounds with high rates of fire.
3709	0.2173333333	Theoretically anything possessing Vitality, with its Intelligence and Volition, could do it, but only to the 'vitality lock' and 'vitality supply' it already possesses.
4961	0.368	But what hoops will Chicago gun owners have to jump through in the future?
4748	0.43516666670000004	There is no such thing as a right to drive.
4268	0.6198571429	First, I propose that we quit making the ridiculous distinction between "gun violence" and violence in general.
3522	0.184	First of all, where do you get turning life around due to evolution?
4134	0.7623333333	But they did rule it's unconstitutional to make criminals register their illegally possessed weapons.
3602	0.511	In this process the affected parts of the organism first develop novel behaviours that induce morphogenic changes, then inherit them epigenetically, and finally, incorporate them genetically.
713	0.4325	So Supreme Court doesn't have the final say.
4186	0.6674	First of all, your argument assumes that using a gun "irresponsibly" always results in a murder.
2214	0.539	But you can rely on 'what if this person is innocent', keep them in prison for life.
2923	0.6646666667	If you have two different componets that evolve separately, when placed together, they can also begin to serve a third purpose when they are together due to their interactions with eachother.
1810	0.778	Sometimes it seems that judges and the police actually think a restraining order is sufficient to keep an irate man from killing his ex-wife.
3486	0.34925	But I never put the lessor theory above the greater.
3141	0.56325	So you are claiming that a single species that splits into populations that can no longer breed did not have a common ancestor species.
1827	0.7694	If this were being looked at from a religious standpoint, the Ten Commandments clearly state: "Thou shalt not kill."
1155	0.3473333333	He has out right sperated this country, and is a disgrace to this country.
1324	0.147	I agree that they set the constitution up in this way, but it stands to reason that the idea for the govt.
4312	0.6026666667	So you are saying that the ban does not affect criminals.
510	0.5814	Sex is not just for reproduction.
1680	0.8486	if a person kills another person it is murder, whether it is sanctioned by the state or not.
499	0.606	So if you want to use your bible as a weapon against gay marriage, and if you fear this all leading to incestial marriage or poligamy, what is going to be your weapon against stopping that?
4877	0.44075	But what you cannot do is charge him with obstructing justice for refusing to talkbecause that would be prosecuting him for refusing to give up a constitutional right.
1856	0.7575	If you read the post then you do understand you've made the determination that you forgo all the trappings of a civilized society if you intentionally attempt to harm me or my family.
1388	0.188	What are the other issues involved in your view?
3719	0.221	So SuperSport I take that as you're fleeing for your proverbial life?
2386	0.373	Read again: "I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, NOT THE SMALLEST LETTER, NOT THE LEAST STROKE OF A PEN, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished."

1540	0.0	to be strong, to rule, fr.
1217	0.29525	First off, I'd like you to explain why my view is selfish.
2681	0.8626666667	How does requiring things in science class to be "testable theories [and hypothesis] which have been thoroughly observed, identified, described, experimentally investigated and remain unrefuted" dumb down science?
2993	0.715	but if you want my opinion, id have to say the egg.
1191	0.33175	emoticonXRolleyes And "vilification" is negative.
1542	0.0	First, I AIN'T your honey .
3301	0.46299999999999997	First off you creationist need to know what you're arguing about.
3324	0.14400000000000002	If I guessed on the topic based on what the link says I would have thought it was about NASA or the Space Shuttle not evolution.
2539	0.9756666667	My point was that Darwin's idea of gradualism-only for the evolutionary development of new characteristics has been shown to be wrong.
953	0.441	First off the Treaty of Tripolli.
4846	0.4375	But I already know none of what I say, will change anything either.
4330	0.6414	If we don't like how the ATF operates, we don't have the option of just voting the head of the ATF out of office the next year.
732	0.5478	I bet they easily match the percentage of Americans who once approved of slavery.
1156	0.34700000000000003	y a w n P.S. Are they paying you by the word now?
4980	0.325	This is one of the things the Gun Control people are pushing.
3294	0.48475	So if there is one exception to an observed rule, it invalidates the entire rule?
2982	0.677	So you attempt to refute natural selection with directed variation and then attempt to use that to convince us of directed variation?
2156	0.581	But since he's there, the other criminal gets an "early out" and he's likely to commit more crimes.
1062	0.3663333333	You clearly do not understand the difference.
2616	0.8433333332999999	If you can grip a tree with a birds foot and climb it while your preadator can't would be a great advantage.
1167	0.377	First, it's flawed in the fact that it's a GUILT BY ASSOCIATION fallacy.
3222	0.722	Both these posters made 'just-so' statements about their own opinions with regards to evolution.
3636	0.23199999999999998	All of this is really complex, but when the tire meats the road, we see that this is not an example of the evolution of an irreducibly complex system.
2938	0.626	I agree, but for obvious parental "control" some sort of creation should simply be stated as another idea for how life came about.
4491	0.581	Perhaps you should pay more attention, he said small children, I myself have never encountered a kid that did not know the difference between the two that was old enough to be playing cops and robbers, I think he was refering only to young children.
3140	0.634	I don't have time to take you through Geology 100.
143	0.774	if the laws change so that gays can get married, then fine.
3577	0.39125	Someone mentioned that you seem to mistrust science and it seems that you do.
2782	0.7976666667	So geology is the only branch of science according to evolutionists?
717	0.5332	So much for the separation of church and state.
1819	0.77225	So let me get this straight, you would violate a womans civil rights to save a fertilized egg, but have no problem killing real people?
2502	0.138	Ok I don't know where to start Calli, you're just being ridiculously close-minded and ignorant.
4360	0.6203333333	So besides adding an enormous cost to flying what good is the added security at the airports?
4171	0.6498	If 28% of Americans own a firearm, then AT BEST, a quarter of the plane will be armed.
395	0.6644	If the legislatures had absolute authority, then we would not have created the judicial branch.
5196	0.18600000000000003	So you'd have no problem with me pointing SAWs and LAWs at your house?
4492	0.616	If you want to do a literal reading of the constitution, neither way supports the collective rights theory.
1365	0.20866666670000003	First of all, you're going to find it cited a LOT LESS than you seem to think it should be.
4899	0.364	I never claimed Heller stated otherwise.
595	0.6163333333	But nowadays people will say, ok here's a new value, but it has no weight because many people will say that is just so and so's morality--it's made up out of thin air and will get no obedience from me.
3952	0.7215	But gun control won't get rid of the guns.
2914	0.727	If you are refering to the dating of xenoliths in 1981 Mt. St. Helens dacites, the issue is not with the dating technique, but with Dr Steve Austin's apparent omission of observations.
2326	0.5893333332999999	So how could LWOP be cruel and unusual?
3766	0.08199999999999999	Of course, wascallywabbit certainly has a different writing style than supersport, but he has not said anything regarding supersport (except here).
3440	0.35575	First, the website has nothing to do with evolution.
3851	0.825	First, a national system would prevent this by scaring those "friends" into not buying the guns legally and selling them illegally, for if the guns are used in an illegal crime, that person can be held accountable.
4132	0.6741666667	So if you're trying to associate mass murder by the government with gun banning then you're not doing a very good job.
4932	0.34725	But know you say your happy to call the "professionals", what happens if they say well we don't have the resources?
2143	0.5920000000000001	But why do we go through all the court and trial and jury deciding the death penalty is the punishment and then repute it later?
1571	0.9434	An argument for putting people to death is so that they can never escape and kill again.
4079	0.6996666667	The claim that self-defense with a firearm is illegal in Australia is false.
1122	0.31033333329999996	The only way anyone could meet your standards is for everyone to become Mother Theresa.
2786	0.7956666667	If you are saying that all the different species I listed were on the ark, we can have a discussion about how many different species would fit on the ark.
2967	0.6459999999999999	If we had accidentally been in an era when the sun was expanding, the creationists may have declared that the sun would soon expand away to nothing meaning that the sun couldn't be as old as scientists claim it is!
2504	0.132	Read the whole verse, not just part of it.
3465	0.4726	Your argument about dwarves and giants determined by a single protein works on an individual level fine but in determining a whole Race within the same genome group, not so fine.
675	0.5892	First of all, what makes you think you speak for "black people" as if black people were some sort of monolithic group that all sahred your personal opinions?
2808	0.795	Refuting creationism isn't a problem.
3348	0.462	First we were discussing genes/adaptive mutations/evolution, and then peripherally, your computer 'simulation', which you claimed was 'stochastic' [undirected and non-directional, ateleological and unsystematic] but which was and is undeniably heuristic [diected, directional, teleological and systematic].
728	0.4328	So in other words, you desire to have a right over and above what is currently allowed by law and society.
412	0.63	So if the law is going to start extending to behaviors then it will need to be ratified into the constitution.
3146	0.818	But if what makes a good door changes by natural selection in order to become a good window -- at which point it's no longer a good door -- this is not by chance.
1516	0.04	But that's not the point.
825	0.5005714286	but you have yet to show a link between hormonal imbalance and sexual preference.
3267	0.5423333333	First you need to understand that macroevolution is evolution at or above the species level.
3974	0.75	So by your plan, we can all carry guns on the plane, that includes both law abiding citizens and terrorists alike.
616	0.5765	I know that Canada doesn't share the same aversion to the words "socialism or communism" that we have in the States.
114	0.826	But I dont think the government should be telling people what to do with their bodies as long as they are not hurting others.
417	0.6546	There is a separation of church and state.
3069	0.591	Certainly Montalban has read "Origin" since he quotes it.
1625	0.8916	ok guys, a more extensive reply is on the way, but first i have to ask you anti-capital punishment guys this: If we take your arguments to their logical extreme, we must then say that ANY FORM of ANY punishment is immoral.
5320	0.05	Thanks now were getting somewhere.
4185	0.6038	But you accept that they can take away your rights - hopefully they ARE following due process, but this doesn't seem to happen so much if you're black.
2896	0.7005	So, in fact you are now saying that Darwin was persuaded by Wallace to use a meaningless term in place of his term 'Natural Selection'.
5020	0.30833333329999996	Firstly, I don't claim that population density is the only factor.
2082	0.6242	so it is better to keep them locked up like animals, and hope that they do not escape and do more harm?
753	0.5161666667	So if they go by some other name, use some other form, they are wrong, and yours are right?
2546	0.9723333332999999	First of all, every theory in science is methodologically atheistic, but no theory can ever falsify the existence of God.
3969	0.713	If the criminal has the zapper to make you an easier target it means he can't use his gun either, so at the worst you are back to square one but on the other hand it is a lot harder for him to threaten you without getting you by suprise (at which point the gun zapper is a bit pointless anyway if he is going to secretly ambush you) as you can acttract attention easier and there is a much greater risk to him.
3373	0.39899999999999997	But these are the very instincts that he says frustrate and impede the law of natural selection in modern society.
4107	0.6645	But, according to Bryan, the right to bear arms is always absolute, right?
2444	0.29	If my husband abused me, I'd cut his fucking balls off.
4380	0.5761666667	Are the more restrictive gun law states safer than the less restrictive states?
1066	0.3375	If you want to live in a theocracy why don't YOU move to the Middle East or shut up?
3913	0.7572	So what is wrong with a total ammunition ban then, in addition to the gun ban as dogs could sniff out the ammunition being shipped in and the un shop records provide you witha lsit of gun owners.
3498	0.4533333333	But it was evolution, wasn't it?
2738	0.792	First of all this thread was originally about creation/intelligent design and how they differ from each other.
4000	0.7343333333	So if you want to stop gun deaths, then you focus your effort on white men who want to kill themselves.
1568	0.946	If you are going to argue for or against the death penalty, at least try to be a credit to the argument and present something that makes sense.
2427	0.31933333329999997	So you're saying that Japan's well ordered society isn't peaceful in nature?
3746	0.16	so, Kind; genus, each with x amount of different species species are communities of individuals that can "interbreed successfully".
4984	0.32299999999999995	Omegamon, In your last post, you passed the short answer quiz, since you selected one case over another.
1687	0.861	So how about we stop a penalty that has executed innocents?
851	0.44375	If you had been a member for a while, you'd know that I'm against all Federal social engineering endeavors, so why would I want to add one more?
3546	0.3393333333	But as I keep saying, evolution doesn't make these kinds of predictions.
895	0.4638	If the public had a say, do you think Mass would have gay marriage?
4592	0.5015	Which branch of service was Obama in?
335	0.6882857143000001	So get off whether it's a disorder or not, I'm not debating that here, I'm asking what you guys think: That if it could be proven that homosexuality is a mental disorder that homosexual marriage shouldn't be allowed.
2839	0.71925	If it must be allowed into schools at all it should be confined to the religious studies classroom, not the science laboratory.
3087	0.5803333333	So the fossil record should show a large number of fossils during environmental changes, and we should see extinctions happing regularly with overspeciated kinds.
4611	0.5626666667	Government cannot do an illegal search.
1348	0.201	I agree but I guarantee you that after all my years of going to church with them.
1015	0.4184	First of all, What is Marriage?
2816	0.78025	If the theory can stand up to the harsh tests of scientific method, it can easily stand up to the firebrand skepticism spouted from the pulpits of the ringleaders of some 60% of Americans.
1631	0.882	But killing someone because of him killing someone is quite hypocritical.
2489	0.19399999999999998	In the personal life of a Christian, we turn the other cheek.
3730	0.20033333329999997	If only you would allow intelligent design to live that double life!
3251	0.634	Some changes due to speciation have occurred, but not the large scale changes that evolution supposes.44 http://www.straight-talk.net/evolution/living.htm
4978	0.17300000000000001	First, you obviously have not read many of the older messages, or you would know better.
2070	0.6353333333	But most of the money comes with the appeals.
4452	0.551	So how would you make a study that shows the benefits of gun ownership?
5245	0.1505	So who is the N.G. loyal to?
1635	0.8782	Dsa posted some figures on the old forum saying that less people end up dying if the death penalty is kept in place.
4646	0.509	So your theory that average citizens will defeat the terrorists is a hope.
2479	0.235	But Jesus stooped down, and wrote on the ground with his finger.
2265	0.455	But surely he was cut off from God from the moment he forgave the prostitute.
2959	0.687	So what you are doing is taking the over all theory and breaking it up into several parts, such as astronomical evolution, chemical evolution, geological evolution, biological evolution?
5085	0.2853333333	Do they get convicted of murder and go on trial?
3059	0.674	Nope its obvious that if the genes mutate then the organism mutates- after all the genes are part and parcel of the organism - at least so far for all known organisms.
2141	0.59325	If an 18 year old can kill, and be aware that he's killing, and have enough malicious intent to want to do it again, why can't a 17 year old, or a 16 year old?
3118	0.607	Youll notice that I brought this subject up without immediately insulting and name calling anyone in astronomy, something evolutionists dont always do when starting a topic about ID or Christianity.
5078	0.2994	If they did, the people would surely shake off the yoke of tyranny, as America did.
4045	0.7138571429	So if you're really interested in enforcing gun laws, don't support the NRA.
3356	0.5635	But I do understand the argument: that's why I have a problem with creationism when it claims to be science.
2744	0.7756666667000001	If you are saying that there are a few crackpots even in the science fields, I will agree with you.
3506	0.64	If there is some sort of magical barrier that prevents animals from crossing the mythical kind barrier, there must be many organisms that are at that barrier.
1679	0.84875	If someone kills a massive number of people is it fair in the victims eyes to have someone sit in jail for the rest of their lives?
4249	0.6285714286	But doesn't the legal right to bear arms stem from everyone supposedly being in the militia?
3147	0.6314	Yeah, but that pretty much describes YECs who use the science in their every day lives that they reject for public consumption because of their belief in mythology.
2294	0.4686	But again, how do you measure deterrence?
580	0.55625	So you are arguing against marriage benefits.

2773	0.7979999999999999	first of all, the story of creation does more than explain how the world came to be.
2731	0.825	So the real question is, since your church teaches that evolution is wrong, and you believe what your church teaches, is there any evidence that could be presented that you would accept as convincing evidence for evolution?

995	0.426	So America does not care for the rights of the people?
1981	0.6844	if you look at my previous argument I talk about letting them die the way they killed their victims.
4297	0.6995	But I also think that it was the time for someone American to criticise America; Id wish it was someone with real arguments but maybe the sledgehammer was needed to wake people up first so they go gather information themselves and not only listen.

3073	0.669	No, it doesn't make darwinism an intentional process.
3943	0.7621666667	First off, I believe that guns, like cars, should be legal.
1585	0.9268	The death penalty is hypocritical.
1955	0.7028	If you believe that, then you should therefore think Scott Peterson shouldn't be executed as there was no solid evidence he commited the crime.
3152	0.5526666667	So when you might say "Species A" has evolved into "Species A1" and "Species A2", someone else might say "Nope, they're still the same species", thus undermining your idea of evolution.

1363	0.21	In the first post in the thread, from Vitter's own statement, he refers to his "sin" and also to "God".
2612	0.8845	But that definition gets confusing when several evolutionists here claim that creationism cannot be proven or disproven, while other evolutionists here (such as many in the thread that I linked above) claim that it is possible, or that it has been done.
2824	0.77425	Some evolutionists do purposely set out to decieve people with frauds (such as some of the countless so called ape men, the embryonic recapitulation and so on) and it is these people that I am attacking.
2041	0.6535	So, what are some of the reasons why we impose various types of punishments on criminal offenders?
241	0.7301666667	These statements were inaccurate, since the questions that generated these statistics were about lifetime same-sex sexual activity, not merely sex with adults (e.g., for men ever done any of the following with another male [6% ever, but 2.9% in last 12 months; 1.6% reported such behavior only with men], and for women ever had any sexual experience of any kind with another female (p. 9) [11.2%; 4.4% in last 12 months; 1.3% only with female(s)]).
