721	0.5298333332999999	What we do not have are RIGHTS!
4554	0.5924	So you see there is no way that you can have a Government national guard and call them "the people".
1164	0.1335	I just call it like I see it, that doesn't make me wrong.
626	0.60775	So we should not give gays their rights, because they might become millitant?
944	0.44575	If by "need" you mean need to live, then of course not.

2620	0.89225	But if you count the number of mutations from microevolution over the period of time they occur and then apply that formular to over a large scale you do get the large differences in genetic code between organisms.
1144	0.043	Ah well now you're opening a completely new can of worms.
4728	0.4418571429	I would give you about a 1 in 50 chance if getting it on the ground (note I said ground, not even runway) without killing someone.

3134	0.5723333333	If you behold and step back a bit the wonderful that the human being as such represents, will be able to get out as conclusion that whether as much as the science be there in advancement or the own human being brain had grown, developed and evolutionated enough to explain at least partially these couple of big mysteries that men always have asked to themselves and as long as they exist will ever be there continueing asking to themselves, you will figure out that there is a huge shortfall not to state an unreachable gap between what the man objectively and yet somehow potentially had there been able to discover and the point whereby still using as tool the science most highly procedures and even all sort of top notch gadgets which by the way almost every day are coming out i would dare to budge for you, really became to grab to accomplish there some meanful break through upon this matter.

230	0.6509999999999999	Sure they are not in favor of gay marriage and wish to keep in with the more traditional definition of marriage but that is not to say that they are going to take away their fundamental rights.
3208	0.6933333333	First, mutations are referred to as mistakes, as if all mutations are errors that cause problems; and second, the implication is that mutations that lead to change can only lead to death, not improvement.
3802	0.8778	Only 12% of Americans think our gun laws are too strict.
3916	0.7778571429000001	So I don't see restrictions on handguns in D.C. as being a clear violation of the Second Amendment.
2629	0.8759999999999999	So far, the Laws of Science appears to agree with the Bible and lean away from evolution.
1027	0.4135	It is not logical to argue in that manner as it only points to the opposite.
842	0.44799999999999995	but how does that necessarily correlate to sexual preference (which is the basis of homosexuality)?
969	0.43325	But to state that it's integrity will be compromised has a negative connotation.
491	0.47825	First, I hope you actually mean "belief", "opinion" and "faith" to refer only to the issue of existence of a supreme being.
5073	0.2742857143	But I am debating it is a security risk that doesn't need to be taken.

1912	0.723	But you would likely be executing innocent people.
549	0.6038333333	I'm not even sure how giving or protecting civil rights could be harmful, but if it happens we can deal with it then.

3311	0.5516	So the simpler developmental processes (simpler adult-form end product, fewer interactions between developmental genes, etc.) of early animals would have allowed for a 'large-scale' change to be incorporated into that animal's ontogeny, though if a change of the same magnitude were to occur today, it would be too disruptive to the complex developmental program and would be eliminated (note that 'large-scale change' refers to the adult form: the actual change that caused that altered end result could be a typical small scale mutation, in an early developmental stage).

3044	0.6809999999999999	You point out an example where christians question a mans personal faith, and I point out a fraud which was perpetrated against millions of students over multiple generations, even though Haeckel was proven wrong way back in 1830 "Another Evolution Fraud Exposed" Biblically-based scientists have always known that the theory of evolution is fraught with false evidence.

4724	0.4438	Firstly: There was never any such thing as an "assault weapon" until the left made it up.
3133	0.6366666667	So you're saying that science finds it's greatest threat from creationism concerning paleontology and archaeology?

3209	0.609	First you argued that "evolutionists" decided on species by appearance, and now you are arguing that "evolutionists" decide by ability to interbreed.

3809	0.8688333333	Of course a semi-automatic .223 caliber rifle is not the same as a chemical weapon, but the point is that (I think) most people don't think that you should be able to own absolutely any weapon that you want, so one must attempt to define what is too dangerous for ordinary citizens to own.
1270	0.1896	First, The situation in California is a completely different situation than the example of the Loving.

318	0.6086666667	So if I understand you correctly the majority of men in marriages to women now are actually gay.
2865	0.7555	first of all, it would mean that God set the universe into existence, allow it to naturally and spontaneously develop for billions of years, then step back in to intervene when humans attained a certain evolutionary level.
4017	0.6833333333	So you see, if you want reduce crime, (which would resul in safer places to live) then what you need is less gun controll laws.
3774	0.0555	But those aren't presuppositions of science.
437	0.6411666667	so what you are saying is that I shouldn't be allowed to choose who my family is?
2549	0.946	Walking-fish: I see 3 things that contribute to the rise of creationism: 1) lack of vigilence about separating church & state 2) lack of good public education (esp in the sciences) 3) extreme poverty where people turn to fanatical religion for a sense of hope In America our declining public education system, which some politicians want to privatize, and widening gap between rich & poor is making more & more people susceptible to the sophisms of very clever creationist pundits.

1224	0.196	First off I guess if it were genetic it would change so many things.
764	0.5175	I was responding to the statement "the presence of LOVE in a marriage should obviously be more important than "man/woman"; that's what I was calling "wish-list" territory.

2052	0.6442	If he is to be punished for eternity, then a couple of decades delay is no big deal.
3442	0.627	If that is truly 'the point of the thread', then we've already settled it several posts ago in favour of the Modern Synthesis, with the experiment designed to distinguish between induced, post-stimulus and random, pre-stimulus mutation.
5304	0.076	So then, what does that mean?
3286	0.9329999999999999	Sorry but the colony as a whole DOES NOT carry the mutation only a very few cells within the colony mutate.
1115	0.3683333333	But what everyone has been saying is that nothing is 'just wrong', things are wrong for a reason.
1818	0.8859999999999999	So as long as only some innocent people are killed for crimes they didn't commit then the system must be sound.

3077	0.6659999999999999	Some years ago there was an hypothesis that proposed jumps in species.
1075	0.327	If I said that, it doens't mean I've followed it from the beginning; after all, didn't you say 'gay rights is much older than you think' or something like that?
5158	0.2055	so the passengers were content to sit still and let things unfold and the FBI etc would negotiate and they would released in a few hours etc.
789	0.5098333333	But the Loving case was about a man and woman getting together, not same-gender people.
1421	0.1503333333	So my point is an empirical one.
5290	0.091	If you would like to get into a real deatailed look at the study, we can do that, though we amy want another thread.
4688	0.46399999999999997	First off, was she about to be attacked before she shot him?
2985	0.6555	Sounds like you agree that animals do evolve into different species over time.
420	0.6535	But the one constant is that it's always been between a man and woman.
12	0.8875	First you attack same-sex relationships, and then when people respond to those attacks, you claim that they are not reading your posts and that you never said gay people shouldn't be allowed to marry.
3931	0.769	This was a unique situation.
1379	0.1952	First of all I don't like politics, so talking to me about Dick Cheney is to no avail.
4056	0.6598	First, the Supreme Court, the highest authority in the land, has ruled that the police have absolutely no duty to provide protection to anyone.
289	0.8213333333	So, wanting not to be denied marriage based your sexual orientation is not wrong, is what you are saying =D Bigotry at its best.
3739	0.036000000000000004	But hey, let's do what L*rch did earlier a) blame the Chinese b) blame Nat Geographic c) blame Montalban for raising this issue d) blame anyone but the scientists who made a mistake.
807	0.5051666667	A very good argument for getting the government out of "marriage".

4822	0.4712	But nevertheless, you, and others who HATE our Freedoms, must continually SCAM away!

2154	0.4933333333	Most death row cases take many years to be judged.
1454	0.1075	First, I DO see your side of it.
2312	0.3643333333	But yet you clamor for death as 'the right thing to do' in other social circumstances without defining 'many purposes'.
2833	0.74925	But since mutations do occur at random all the time, we don't need a special reason to believe that one of them was fortuitously adaptive.

3926	0.7742857143	Firstly, the Second Amendment is a limitation on US Federal Power, not State power.
2775	0.802	If religion is real, science will be happy to have proven it so.
2686	0.9203333333	But it should be the job of science to establish a clear line between just where established fact stops and philosophy starts.
5012	0.3115	Tell me please, which side of the road do you drive on?
3870	0.7848	I do believe that it is right to impose a LIMIT though, such as not allowing people other than law enforcement to take a gun on a plane or in a school.
3182	0.62025	yes, evolution does not conclusively explain the fossils in the cambrian strata, therefore, creatinoist can jump into this gap with "see!
2287	0.47600000000000003	but you are correct: the man was forgiven and free of sin at that point, with or without jesus' death
445	0.6346	But if it is just some undefined supreme being, or even the very vaguely defined God of the more liberal Christian denominations and Reformed Judaism, then I would not make any statemens about the prospects of a proof or disproof of His existence; any such statement would be meaningless.
4210	0.6426666667	The guns are a lifeline that would allow them to survive.
350	0.7609999999999999	So really the only problem is that it can produce disabled childrenif continued, one off incest isn't really at all damaging (unless one of the original parents of the incesting couple has one of these genetic disorders).
80	0.8321666667000001	I agree that gay rights should not be a debate.
2694	0.8420000000000001	But I've told you, how many times do I need to spell this out... you want to use science as the rule to measure the existence of God, when you know that science can do no such thing, and because it can't you don't believe in God.

561	0.5820000000000001	This isn't "hijacking" the word marriage.
2288	0.47525	So VOR, you would send a innocent man do die?
3933	0.8748	But alas, I sincerely doubt that you care about the actual causes of violence, you just want to use the effects of our problems in order to get guns banned!
4246	0.501	First of all, everything I mentioned IS correct.
4691	0.462	First off, where did any single one of us say that it is impossible to shoot down a plane with a 50 cal?

1010	0.43575	So why would they want this when most will divorce soon afterward as they have already proven!!
4118	0.496	But you missed the point that by making guns illegal, criminals are still going to smuggle them as much as they currently do.
3480	0.369	First behe says that a system that can not evolve stepwise is IC, then he says that a system that formerly performed another function when it was evolving must be IC?

2505	0.132	If there have been "many" cases why can't you just link me to 3?
3887	0.7946	So after we ban guns, we ban knives, right?
4462	0.5475	But for all your boasting and anger and hyperbole, you haven't presented a single fact to back up your claims.
1740	0.8202	So we kill killers, but in the end, end up with more murders.
